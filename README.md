# Elucidário Madeirense (Web Version)

## Overview

**Elucidário Madeirense** is an encyclopedic work about the Madeira Archipelago, first published in 1921. The project was coordinated by Father Fernando Augusto da Silva (1863-1949) as part of the celebrations of the fifth centenary of the discovery of Madeira.

### Contributions
- The entries on the flora and fauna of the archipelago were developed by Carlos Azevedo de Meneses (1863-1928). 
- Additional contributors included Adolfo César de Noronha and Alberto Artur Sarmento.
