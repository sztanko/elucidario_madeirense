    "meta_description": "Elucid√°rio Madeirense is an encyclopedic work about the Madeira Archipelago, first published in 1921. The project was coordinated by Father Fernando Augusto da Silva (1863-1949) as part of the celebrations of the fifth centenary of the discovery of Madeira. Despite the last content update being in 1940, it remains an essential reference for understanding the material and immaterial heritage of the archipelago in terms of historiography.",
