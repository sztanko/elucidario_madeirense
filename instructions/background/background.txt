I am making an encyclopedia website about Madeira, it's nature, history and people.

Draw a website background image to it. It should be a pale coloured illustration in style of 1920-ies, 
displaying beautiful foggy landscape and sea cliffs of Madeira in background and different species of plants in the foreground. Make it schematic and slightly resembling fractals while being still an illustration. Image should be 3:1 width to height ratio.  Remember, this is a website background image, no frames, top row should be of single color.
