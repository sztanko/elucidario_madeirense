    "body": "In the article 'Dairy Industry' (page 149), we made a brief reference to the decrees that created the National Dairy Board of Madeira and established the rules that should regulate its operation. It would have been an opportune time to provide a detailed report on how this organization has fulfilled the duties imposed on it by those decrees, if the space and resources we currently have allowed us to do so. However, it would be a flagrant injustice if we did not at least briefly record here the undeniable benefits that the aforementioned credits, through the same Board, have provided to the economy of the entire district. The subject was treated with the most thoughtful judgment, with profound knowledge of the matter, and with great love for the truth in the valuable and in many ways interesting 'Information and Advertising Bulletins' published by the Madeira Dairy Board, which can be profitably consulted and to which we draw the attention of our farmers. (See Cattle and Butter).",
