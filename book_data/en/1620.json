Gorgulho is interesting from a geological point of view because of the lava currents that can be seen near the mentioned fort. There is an iron staircase and an inclined plane, built by the Wilson Company. In this place, the Funchal City Council built a public swimming pool for bathing and swimming exercises in 1932, which is supplied with seawater. In this place and a short distance from the coast is a small islet called Gorgulho.",
