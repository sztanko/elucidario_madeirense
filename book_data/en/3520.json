    "body": "A leguminous plant widely cultivated in Madeira. To remove the bitterness from the seeds of the white lupine, it is necessary to boil them in water containing some ash and charcoal, and then soak them in water for about eight days, with the water being changed twice a day. People also put the lupine seeds in sacks in the flowing waters of the streams, which considerably speeds up the preparation of these seeds. The white lupine is widely used for soil fertilization and is often cultivated exclusively for this purpose.",
