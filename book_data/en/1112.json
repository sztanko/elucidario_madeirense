The position of Dean of the Funchal Cathedral was created by the very papal bull that established the diocese, with explicit mention of the priest who should perform these functions. Nuno Cão (see this name), whom the Order of Christ sent to Madeira with special powers, was the first parish priest of the Cathedral when this parish was created, and also the first dean, positions that in the early times were cumulatively held by the same individual. Nuno Cão was succeeded by Filipe Rebelo, and upon his death, the position of dean was separated from that of parish priest, leading to the creation of two curacies exclusively dedicated to parish service. The last ecclesiastics to occupy the deanery of the Funchal Cathedral were Antonio Joaquim Gonçalves de Andrade, Aires de Ornelas de Vasconcelos, and João Joaquim Pinto (see these names). Until the establishment of the Republic, to be appointed to this position, it was necessary to have a degree in law or theology. Regarding the deanery of the Funchal Cathedral and the priests who held this high ecclesiastical office, read the series of articles published in \"O Jornal\" in the months of December 1935 and January 1936.",
