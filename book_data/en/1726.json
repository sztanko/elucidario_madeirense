    "body": "By decree of March 17, 1911, a commission composed of distinguished men of letters was appointed, among whom were some who had become notable for their writings on the Adjacent Islands, a commission whose special mission was to collect and publish in a publication entitled Arquivo Insular all the documents that could be of interest to the history of the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. This commission promptly set up and met several times, making various decisions about the important work to be carried out, among which stood out the publication of manuscript articles and unpublished documents and the reissue of rare and difficult to acquire works, thus providing a relevant service to Portuguese culture and particularly to those dedicated to the study of our early discoveries and the initial undertakings of our overseas colonization. For reasons unknown to us, this commission did not have a long duration and did not produce work worthy of appreciation, despite its official character and the competence that distinguished all its members.",
