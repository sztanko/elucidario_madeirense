    "body": "He was a man of rare talent and remarkable literary abilities, who was severely affected by adversity, not allowing his intellectual gifts to shine and be appreciated as they truly deserved. We know little about his biography, despite being a contemporary figure. We know that he was a primary education teacher and dedicated himself to journalism, revealing remarkable writing qualities. In Funchal, he was the editor of Noticioso and Paiz, and in Lisbon, he collaborated with Parlamento, Conservador, and Monitor Portuguez, alongside the leading journalists, as attested by a contemporary witness. He was a colleague in the editorial team of Revolução de Setembro, with our first journalist António Rodrigues de Sampaio, who greatly appreciated him. He died abandoned in a hospital bed on December 21, 1874.",
