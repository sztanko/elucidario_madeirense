    "body": "Also called Forte Novo. It was located in the curtain of Nossa Senhora do Calhau, at Corpo Santo. It had a Renaissance-style gate, surmounted by an inscription, topped by a crown ornamented and finely worked in white marble, showing that the fortification works ordered by the Captain-General Duarte Sodré Pereira on the Island were completed in 1707. This fort had a furnace for firing burning projectiles, which were taken out with iron tongs and inserted into the mouth of the loaded cannon with a wetted wad of tow. Due to the heat, the cannon fired, and the red-hot projectile reached the decks of wooden ships, causing damage and setting them on fire. It was demolished in 1897.",
