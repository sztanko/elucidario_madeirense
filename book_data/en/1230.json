There are three volumes of 636, 659, and 706 pages published in the years 1849, 1850, and 1852, which can still be read and consulted with great benefit for the history of Madeira, especially at that time. In addition, they provide a valuable lesson and the most salutary example for all those who wish to conduct themselves correctly in the administration of public affairs.",
