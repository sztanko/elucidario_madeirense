    "body": "It is the responsibility of the rural guards appointed and paid by the Municipal Councils and a special police force of rural and forestry police guards, created by the extinct Agricultural Board, under the terms of the regulation of March 8, 1913. This force should have, when complete, 3 chief guards, 5 mounted guards, and 25 foot guards, under the direction of the district silvicultural regent.\n\nFrom the Regimento das Madeiras, of 1562, and other ancient diplomas, it can be seen that the guarding and conservation of the forests were then entrusted to the judges and aldermen, to the mountain bailiffs, and to the magistrates of the two jurisdictions of the island, the latter being responsible, in the month of January of each year, for conducting inquiries to discover the authors of any damage caused to the trees.\n\nHaving been extinct, the Agricultural Board temporarily entrusted the rural and forestry police service to the Agricultural Station of the 9th Region, under the terms of article 33 of the decree of April 3, 1922 (1922).",
