    "body": "He was the governor and captain general of this archipelago from 1677 to 1766. The commentator of 'Saudades da Terra' calls him the 'reformer par excellence', also becoming known as the 'Madeiran Pombal', both because he was appointed to this position by the Marquis of Pombal and because of the reforms he carried out in many public services during the government of that statesman. Among the services he provided, it stands out that he personally went to the island of Porto Santo to implement the famous royal decree of the 'Fifths and Eighths', which caused a great sensation at the time.",
