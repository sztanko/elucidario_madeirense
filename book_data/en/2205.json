    "body": "A shark of the Lamnidae family, which also lives in the seas of Setubal, Buarcos, and Sesimbra. It attacks humans and destroys several useful species, and is therefore hunted by fishermen, especially when it approaches the coast. It is also known by the name 'anequim'.\n\nIt is with the *bicheiro* (see this name) that fishermen usually catch marrachos, killing them afterwards with a club or by any other means.",
