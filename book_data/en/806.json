    "body": "A populated area on the island of Porto Santo. In this place, known as Graça, there was an ancient chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Graça, which gave the place its name. Being very ruined, its reconstruction in larger proportions was undertaken at the beginning of the last century, but the construction was not completed, and today only a few ruins remain. It had a certain architectural splendor and an octagonal interior, being said in some places to be a miniature reproduction of a famous sanctuary in Italy. It has 16 households and 70 inhabitants.",
