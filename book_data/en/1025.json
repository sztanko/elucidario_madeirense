The flows at Pôrto do Moniz, which are depicted in a drawing in Carlos Lyell's Elements of Geology, have a particularly recent appearance, with one of them forming a rugged mass that extends beyond the coastline. The lava at Gorgulho is on the coast, near the site where a small fort once stood, and it has several excavations where seawater is deposited.\n\n> Correntes Maritimas. V. Gulf Stream.",
