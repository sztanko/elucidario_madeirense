    "body": "The Passifloraceae known as 'maracuj치' to the people of Madeira are as follows: *Passiflora ligularis* from Peru; *P. edulis* from Brazil; *Tacsonia mollissima* from Quito; *T. Van Wolxemii* from New Granada; and *T. Parritae* from Tolima. The genus Passiflora is distinguished from the genus Tassonia by having a very short calyx tube. The first species (yellow passion fruit or 'maracuja amarelo') and the second (purple passion fruit or 'maracuj치 roxo') are the most appreciated on the island. It is said that the juice of the fruits of *P. edulis* is useful in the treatment of cancerous diseases.",
