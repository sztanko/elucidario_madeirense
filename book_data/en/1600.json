    "body": "He was born on this island in 1543, the son of Cristovam Martins de Agrinhão and D. Joana Gomes de Castro. He was a descendant of João Gomes, the Troubadour, and administered the entailed estate he inherited from his parents. He studied outside this island and had a reputation among his contemporaries as a man of broad erudition. He cultivated poetry, with several nobiliaries stating that he was an excellent Latin poet. Barbosa Machado, in the 'Biblioteca Lusitana,' discusses Tristão Gomes de Castro, citing the work he wrote in two volumes, 'Argonautica da Cavallaria, Façanhas de Lesmundo,' which remained unpublished. He died in 1611.",
