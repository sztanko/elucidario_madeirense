    "body": "Conch of a gastropod mollusk of the genus Triton, often caught in shallow waters with trawl nets. It is the largest univalve shell in our seas. Coastal sailors use it as an acoustic siren to signal the departure or arrival of boats, cargo reception, etc. It is also used by the peasant on certain occasions to call companions to revolt. In general, the term is used to designate any shell, no matter how small, of the genus Triton, and also any univalve that resembles that genus in shape.\n\nIn Porto Santo, small shells belonging to the genera Columbella, Murex, and Ranella are found, with Columbella rústica being very abundant on the beach. In Madeira, the Purpura hoemmastoma, 4 to 5 centimeters long, Mitra cornicula, Murex corallinus, Bittium reticulatum, Rissoa violacea, Mitra zebrina, and Cypraea spurca are not rare.",
