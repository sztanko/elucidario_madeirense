It was to this wine, improved by the action of time, that the island owed its reputation as a wine-producing country. Canteiro wine is sometimes used in the production of other types of wine.\n\n## Wheel Wine\n\nThe old Madeira merchants sometimes sent their wine on a journey to cross the Equator, receiving it back on the return trip improved by the action of the high temperatures it experienced in the ship's hold. The wines that went to hot regions and returned to Madeira were called wheel wines. The estufas (heated chambers) were created to provide the wine with prolonged heat, capable of producing effects similar to those produced by the heat of the ship's hold.\n\n## See Estufas.",
