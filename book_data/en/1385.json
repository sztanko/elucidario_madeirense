    "body": "The first tree festival in Funchal was promoted by the Primary Education Inspection and took place on March 29, 1914, at 11 o'clock in the morning. The procession left the São Lourenço Palace for Campo da Barca or Miguel Bombarda, where the ceremony of planting some exotic essences took place. On that occasion, there were some speeches in which the speakers advised the bystanders, especially the children, to regard the trees as sacred objects because of the great benefits they provide.\n\nThe trees solemnly planted on March 29, 1914, were dry a few months later, as no one else thought of them after the promoters of the festival and the people who graced it with their presence left Campo da Barca!",
