    "body": "Several species of dipterans are known by this designation, the most common of which is the Musca domestica, a troublesome insect that lives mainly in and around dwellings, but when in the larval state, is found in manure heaps and in all places where there is dung. The bluebottle fly (Calliphora erythrocephala) is also common, and the greenbottle flies (Lucilia Caesar and L. sericata) appear on trees, in human and animal excrement, etc. It is a fly of the genus Hypoderma that, by laying eggs under the skin of cattle, causes the tumors that appear with a certain frequency in the same cattle, the said larvae being known in Madeira and Porto Santo by the name of 'berros'.",
