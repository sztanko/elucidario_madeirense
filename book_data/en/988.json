    "body": "This square was named as such since January 28, 1821, because it was on this day that the constitution, that is, the liberal principles of 1820, was proclaimed there. Before that, it was known by the name of Passeio Publico, which was still often used in our days. Praça da Constituição was renamed Praça da Republica in 1911, and disappeared in 1914, when the construction of Avenida Oeste, now Dr. Manuel de Arriaga Avenue, began, which also includes the land of the former Jardim Pequeno. Praça da Constituição was a shaded area where the regimental band used to play. There were beautiful specimens of Indian fig trees, magnolias, seedlings, and grevilleas.",
