The second species, also called crayfish or spiny lobster, is less common than the first, and is caught like it, either by diving or accidentally in nets and other gear. The Arctus ursus, occasionally found in the seas of Funchal and Porto Santo, is not considered edible. In the \"Diário de Notícias\" of Funchal on October 26, 1927, Adolfo César de Noronha published an extensive and interesting article about these crustaceans under the title \"The Lobster of Madeira\".",
