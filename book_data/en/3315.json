    "body": "He was born in Funchal on July 17, 1845, and passed away in this city on October 31, 1911. He was a bachelor graduated in philosophy and medicine from the University of Coimbra and practiced medicine in Funchal. He also taught at the former Medical-Surgical School and the subjects of physics, chemistry, and natural history at our high school. He wrote a compendium of physics for use in secondary institutes, which he did not manage to publish, we believe, because he lost his sight a few years before his death and abandoned scientific studies from then on.
