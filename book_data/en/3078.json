    "body": "These natural aqueducts that generally flow in the beds of deep and narrow valleys are quite numerous on this island and have very abundant flows in the winter season. They originate in the central mountain range and flow into the ocean, some of them having subsidiary streams that increase their volume and speed. 'All of them, in the winter,' says the illustrious commentator of the 'Saudades,' 'bring abundant water, often torrential: they then fill up, and sometimes overflow, dragging thousands of tons of more or less large boulders from the mountains, many of them so large that afterwards, they can only be removed in pieces, and all, rolling in the torrent, collide with each other, producing a sinister noise, until, obstructing the beds of the same streams, they make them overhang the marginal lands, and these, when not obstructed, are carried away by the diverted waters to a great distance, out to sea, broken into mud; in the summer, however, the watercourses become scarce, and in some streams they dry up, as a result of the diversions, either for marginal irrigation, or for the 'levadas,' which, taking the running waters there, transport them to fertilize remote crops across the entire surface of the island's coast.' These streams occasionally turn into powerful currents, which, leaving their beds and invading the adjacent banks, violently drag large areas of cultivated land, enclosures, and even houses, causing sometimes considerable personal and material damage to the inhabitants of their vicinity.\n\nThe main streams in Madeira are as follows:\n\n- **Ribeira de Machico**: It originates in Lamaceiros and Portela do Porto da Cruz, and its main tributaries are Ribeira Seca and the streams of Alcanforado, Ermida, Escuro, Cales, and Cova.\n\n- **Ribeira de Santa Cruz**: It rises in Santo António da Serra and its main tributary is the Ribeira da Serra de Água.\n\n- **Ribeira da Boaventura**: It originates to the west of the peak of Abóboras and receives the waters of the streams of João Ferino and Eixo.
