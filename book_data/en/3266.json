    "body": "On the coast of this town, there is a small port with difficult landing. The port of Fajã da Areia (see this name) about two kilometers away from the port of São Vicente is preferable.\n\nThe flow of this stream originates in the mountains of Encumeada de São Vicente, crossing the parish in its greatest extension before flowing into the ocean. At its mouth and in the middle of the stream bed, there is a solitary basalt block where a small chapel dedicated to the martyr São Vicente was built by the people in 1692. Near the mouth of this stream, there is a relatively extensive cave formed by an extinct lava channel.",
