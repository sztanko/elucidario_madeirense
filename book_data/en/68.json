    "body": "A floating colony of marine polyps of the class Hydrozoa and order Siphonophorae, occasionally washed up on the beaches of these islands, especially when the wind blows from the open sea. It is extremely caustic, known among the English as the Portuguese man-of-war and in Italy as Vascello portoguese. Portuguese sailors call it Nau da Índia.\n\nOther hydrozoans in this part of the ocean, such as jellyfish or medusas, are also referred to as Portuguese man o' war. This expression is a variant of água-má, used on the coasts of Portugal. The Portuguese man o' war is also known by the name of água-viva.",
