The town crier, who in the case of municipal orders was the chamber doorkeeper, went out accompanied by a regiment bugler, who played through the city streets to call the people to come and be informed of the same orders. The edict was read aloud by the doorkeeper and then posted in the usual places. The last time there was a 'bando' in Funchal was on the occasion of the obsequies of King Luiz I.",
