    "body": "The lands that currently form the Municipal Garden, Rua Hermengildo Capelo, and the location where the Manuel de Arriaga theater stands, constituted the old enclosure of the convent of S. Francisco. Despite the opposition of the Franciscan religious, the street was opened there in 1814, which was named Rua dos Frades. In 1823, the market built by the city council was opened to the public in the location later designated for the theater, and the adjacent street was then named Rua do Mercado de S. Jo√£o. In 1885, when the explorers Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens visited the island (see these names), the city council decided to name the streets flanking the Municipal Garden after them.",
