    "body": "He was one of our most distinguished soldiers who fought in India. The chronicles that deal with our struggles in the East refer to him with the highest praise. He was the captain of the fortress of Ormuz and distinguished himself remarkably in the capture of Cahul. Gaspar Frutuoso narrates in 'Saudades da Terra' some of his most remarkable military feats.\n\nThis Rui Gonçalves da Camara, who should not be confused with the son of João Gonçalves Zarco and captain-donor of the island of S. Miguel, was the son of João Gonçalves da Camara, the 41st donor of Funchal, and the brother of Father Luiz Gonçalves da Camara and Martim Gonçalves da Camara.",
