    "body": "In the seas of Madeira, there are two species of fish from the Carangidae family, known by this name and according to some authors, they are the Trachurus trachurus and the T. Cuvieri. They seem to arrive irregularly, with seasons of great scarcity and others with abundant shoals. They are sought after either at the bottom of the coastal zone with the gorazeira, or at mid-water with the agulheira, or at the surface with the rod or the circular net, the latter being very profitable when the shoals are abundant. At other times, they are caught in trawl nets, which are also capable of a bountiful catch. Bottom fishing is done during the day, while surface fishing can be done during the day or at night, in which case a lamp known as griseta cão or maçarico, depending on the location, is used, and with its intense light, it is a powerful aid to the fisherman, attracting the fish to the sea surface. The pursuit by tunas, the bicuda, and other migratory species often leads the chicharro to seek shelter in the coastal waters, and the same happens with the mackerel, which is caught by the same methods and is also irregular in its passage. Both are preferred by fishermen as bait over many other species.",
