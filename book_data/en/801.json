    "body": "For a long time, a urban building located on Rua da Conceição, at the corner of Rua da Figueira Preta, was known as Casa dos Consules. It seems to have been an old manor house. It was built in the 18th century and has a certain architectural grandeur. In the past, several consulates were located there, hence the name Casa dos Consules. Even in the early 19th century, some consulates had their headquarters in this house.\n\nIn the valuable book 'Casas Madeirenses' it is written: 'It is an extremely interesting example and worth considering for the originality of some elements that are worthy of being used to provide greater variety in the composition of other buildings. It is a symmetrical but balanced and noble set of a great manorial air. It has a wide triple eaves, and the upper windows are extremely original due to the shape of the pediments that surmount the respective openings.'",
