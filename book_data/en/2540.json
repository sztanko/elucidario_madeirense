The description of this voyage is highly appreciated, and Latino Coelho translated and published the part of this description that deals with this island in the Contemporary Review, which is very interesting and worth reading. It was reproduced in issue no. 2279 and subsequent issues of the defunct Di√°rio do Commercio of this city.",
