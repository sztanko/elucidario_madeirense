    "body": "It is also known by the name Ilhéu do Farol. Adjacent to Ponta de São Lourenço and separated from it only by a narrow channel, is the small islet called Agostinho, very close to it is the Desembarcadouros islet and a short distance away is the Fora or Farol islet. The latter two are separated by a channel known as Boqueirão Grande, which is about 180 meters wide and 8 meters deep, providing easy passage for coastal steamers that frequently transit through there. This is the easternmost point of Madeira and since September 1870, a lighthouse has been operating there, providing relevant services to navigation. The respective lantern is located about 100m above sea level and is situated at 32° and 41' north latitude and 16° and 39' west longitude (Greenwich). It is a white light lighthouse with intermittent flashes, visible from a distance of 25 miles. There is a telegraph station connected to the central station of Funchal. Southwest of the Fora islet is the dangerous shoal of Badajeira (see this name). The altitude of this islet is 107m.",
