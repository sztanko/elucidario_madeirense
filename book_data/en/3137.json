    "body": "Perennial plant of the Rubiaceae family, with linear-lanceolate or sublinear rough leaves, and small flowers arranged in axillary clusters. Its roots are widely used in dyeing, with Madeirans usually washing them first and then crushing them with ripe blackberries. By boiling the mixture with the fabric to be dyed, it acquires a beautiful red color, and it is advisable to boil it again with ash so that this color does not fade. The roots of ruivinha are recommended for rickets and have the property of dyeing the bones of those who use them internally red.",
