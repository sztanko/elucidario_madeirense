    "body": "It was located near the chapel of the same name and was definitively ceded to the Municipality by a deed signed in April 1902. It was, apparently, a fortification ordered to be built during the time of the Filipino dominion. It was occupied by British troops, and it is said that in its vicinity, the capital execution of a British soldier took place, which we have already mentioned on page 427 of the 1st volume of this work, constituting a serious attack on the sovereignty of our country, despite the protests of local authorities.",
