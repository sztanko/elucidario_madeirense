The annotator of the _Saudades_ marks the year 1594 as the year of its construction and says it was founded by Francisco de Bettencourt on the lands of the estate he established there. It was rebuilt in a year that we cannot determine, and about forty years ago, it was extended and notable repair works were carried out.",
