P. de Azevedo and the officials of the Rattermaker on December 20, 1846. The first observations made in the Praça Académica with Gambey's compass indicated an inclination of 59° 30; the second, made in the adro do Colégio with the 'Fox's Dipping' and the 'Intensity Instrument,' gave an inclination of 60° 40.\n\nOn February 4, 1872, and July 17, 1873, the officials of the Challenger found the inclination to be 56° 14' 1 N. and 55° 12 5 N., respectively. More recently, the distinguished Azorean meteorologist, Colonel Francisco Afonso Chaves, found the following magnetic inclinations: 54° 32' 5 N., on June 22, 1903, and 54° 22'7 N., on June 4, 1906. All these observations were made at the parade ground of the Colégio, with Colonel Chaves using the Abbadie-Brunner compass to determine the inclination.",
