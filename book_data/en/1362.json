    "body": "Valentim Fernandes or Valentim Fernandes Alemão was a German printer and editor who settled in Lisbon at the end of the 15th century and became known in the history of our maritime discoveries for having collected some unpublished writings that are of interest to the history of these same discoveries. About these unpublished works, Dr. Schmeller published an interesting memoir in 1845, of which Henrique Major gives a detailed account in his work on Infante D. Henrique. These narratives of some maritime discoveries made by the Portuguese in the 15th century are of interest to the history of the discovery of this archipelago, and therefore Dr. Rodrigues de Azevedo devotes a great deal of attention to them on pages 366-372 and 905 of Saudades da Terra. A part of these narratives, concerning the Azores, was published in volume 1 of Archivo Açoreano. It seems that the remaining manuscripts of Valentim Fernandes' collection are still unpublished.",
