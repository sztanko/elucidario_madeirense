    "body": "Gaspar Frutuoso gives this name to a French corsair who was in the Port of Funchal during the time of the donatary Simão Gonçalves da Camara, count of Calheta. Two hundred Frenchmen disembarked from the corsair's galleons, which numbered seven, to buy provisions in the city and sell many things they had, bringing Jaques Soria as their captain to punish them if they misbehaved. The ships stayed in our port for eight days, and during that time, 'Captain Simão Gonçalves da Camara watched and had the city watched at night with his guards, despite the friendship and peace that the corsair had promised him.'",
