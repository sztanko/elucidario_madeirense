He unofficially acted as an intermediary between the people and the local authorities, especially in cases where legal provisions were not very clear, and could not be elected without having at least six years of experience in the Casa dos Vinte e Quatro.\n\nAccording to a decision made by the Senate of the City of Funchal on December 22, 1802, when the Judge of the People went to the Chamber to 'request something', he sat in a shallow chair (the high-backed chairs were intended for the aldermen and the clerk) above the oldest of the tradesmen.\n\nWe do not know when the position of Judge of the People was created among us, which lasted until 1834.",
