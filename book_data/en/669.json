However, the annotator of the 'Saudades' says that 'it is of Spanish origin and seems to come from D. Fernando Camacho, who served on this island in the Spanish garrison, according to oral information we obtained. In the parish of Caniço, where the island's early settlers lived, this surname still abounds. The name Camacha, of the parish so called, which was separated from Caniço in 1679, suggests that there may have been an ancient landowner with the surname Camacho there.'",
