    "body": "A place in the town of Porto Santo, where there is a fountain whose waters were analyzed in 1893 at the National School of Mines in Paris. The weight of the residue found in a liter of the same water was 1.728 grams, with silica represented by 0.048 grams, sodium carbonate, including alkaline-earth carbonates, by 0.891 grams, sodium sulfate by 0.290 grams, and sodium chloride by 0.490 grams. According to the analyst from the same school, the mineral water of Porto Santo can be classified as bicarbonated and sulfate-sodic waters, with very little lime and magnesia, and almost all the carbonic acid from the bicarbonates is combined with the alkalis.\n\nThey are undoubtedly considered excellent table waters and are widely consumed in Madeira today, also being exported outside the archipelago. There is a fountain at this site that provides these waters to the public, as well as the building of the concessionaire company, which prepares and exports them from that island.",
