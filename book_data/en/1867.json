    "body": "This was the most important position in this fiscal institution, which later came to be known as the 'provedor'. In addition to the direction of the customs house, it was responsible for collecting other revenues and levying various taxes, as we mentioned in the article on Customs Houses (see vol. I, page 36). D. Manuel appointed Francisco Alvares as judge of the customs house of Funchal on February 20, 1494, because he had married a daughter of the previous Judge, and this position continued until the 19th century.",
