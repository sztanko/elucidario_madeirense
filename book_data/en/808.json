    "body": "A cultivated Cupulifera in Madeira since the time when this island began to be populated. In Achada do Campanario, there was a chestnut tree years ago whose trunk measured 10.50m in circumference, and in the Fontes area, in Ribeira Brava, we believe there is still another one, whose trunk measures 11.30m, also in circumference. The chestnut tree, much less common today than in the past, produces, in addition to the fruit, which is consumed in the country, good wood that has many applications. Although it characterizes the 20th botanical zone of Madeira, which ranges from 150 to 200 meters, it can also live near the coast, having existed for many years in the fortress of S. Lourenço, an individual that never failed to bear fruit at the proper time. The annual production of chestnuts in Madeira amounts to 4,000 hectoliters.",
