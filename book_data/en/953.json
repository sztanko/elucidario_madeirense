    "body": "The District Commissions replaced the General Assemblies when these were abolished by the Decree of August 6, 1892. According to the 1895 and 1896 codes, they had administrative litigation responsibilities and were composed of the Civil Governor, president, the Administrative Auditor, and three members elected by delegates of the Municipal Chambers.\n\nThe District Commission of Funchal ceased to exist with the organization and responsibilities mentioned in the 1896 code, after the decree of August 8, 1901, which applied the special organization allowed to the Azorean districts by the law of June 12, 1901.\n\n“The District Commissions mentioned in the administrative codes of 1878 and 1886 were composed of three procurators appointed by the General Assemblies at their first meeting after being elected, thus being mere delegates of these corporations.”\n\nThe law of August 7, 1913 conferred on the Executive Commissions (former District Commissions) delegated from the General Assemblies, the authority to judge the accounts of the managements of brotherhoods, fraternities, etc., and approve the budgets of these corporations.",
