    "body": "A tree of the Lauraceae family, ranging from 6 to 20 meters in height, with persistent and aromatic leaves, umbels grouped in axillary fascicles, usually shorter than the petioles, and ovoid, black, and occasionally yellow berries. It produces light wood, inferior to that of other Madeiran Lauraceae, and its leaves are used as fertilizer in kitchens.\n\nIn the past, oil was extracted from the berries for lighting the homes of the rural areas, obtained by boiling the berries and then squeezing them in a cloth bag in small wooden presses. The oil, being lighter than the rest of the liquid, floated and was easily removed from the container used for the operation.\n\nThe loureiro is found in the first, second, and third zones of Madeira, but in the latter, it is a tree of small dimensions. It used to grow spontaneously in Porto Santo, where it became extinct, but is now cultivated on the island.\n\nOn September 14, 1651, a decree stipulated that only the Count of Vimioso, the lord of Machico, could sell and 'ship off the island' loureiro berries and buy them from individuals.",
