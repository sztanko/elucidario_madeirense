    "body": "A bird of the Falconidae family, which nests in Madeira and can sometimes be seen on the rooftops of houses, even in the center of Funchal. It is much less common today than in the past, due to the hunting pressure it faces from certain hunters. It mainly feeds on lizards, insects, and shrews, but if given the opportunity, it also preys on small birds such as canaries, goldfinches, etc. Its clutch often consists of five or six eggs, of varying shape and color, usually deposited in the crevices of inaccessible rocks.",
