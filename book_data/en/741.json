    "body": "Cape Cantim is located on the coast of Morocco, between the two well-known points of the coast, Mazagan to the north, and Mogador to the south. It is approximately 60 miles equidistant from these two maritime cities. This point on the African continent has a latitude that roughly corresponds to the latitude of the island of Madeira. Cape Cantim is at 32° 33' N and about 47 miles SW.\n¼\nS. of Cape Blanc in the North. It rises steeply to about 60 meters above the sea, and supports a small hermitage on its crown. It is also the point on the African coast that is closest to our archipelago, being about 350 miles away.",
