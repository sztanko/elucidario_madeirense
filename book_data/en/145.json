    "body": "When the clergy had their own jurisdiction, they also had their own prisons or special cells, which were called Aljube. The old Aljube of Funchal was located in the area between Travessa da Sacristia, Rua de João Gago, and Rua do Aljube. The position of aljubeiro or jailer of the Aljube of this city was created by D. Sebastião by royal decree on July 6, 1562. The creation of the Aljube, which already existed in 1834, should be counted from this time or shortly before. During the political struggles between Miguelists and Constitutionalists and during the appeals that then came to this island, many priests were imprisoned in the Aljube due to their partisan inclinations, with some of them being transferred to the Limoeiro and prisons in Africa.",
