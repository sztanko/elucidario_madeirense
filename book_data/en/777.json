    "body": "What we know about the biography of this Madeiran is almost limited to what Dr. Alvaro de Azevedo says on page 806 of 'Saudades da Terra', which we will transcribe:\n\n“Born in the city of Funchal in 1792: here he worked as a stonemason and was an actor, until the court, which came to the island of Madeira in 1823, sentenced him as a liberal to five years of exile in Angola, where he served his sentence. He took the ostentatious surnames he used from the parts he played in the theater. He was a shrewd and adventurous man; therefore, he not only became an opulent merchant in the city of S. Paulo de Loanda, but also a preponderant figure in that overseas possession, a commander of the Order of Christ, and a colonel. Coming in 1846, due to serious accusations, he was imprisoned in the castle of S. Jorge in Lisbon, but managed to free himself. He died a few years later, having written and published, under the title 'Dedo de Pigmeu' (Lisbon, 1843), a collection of intimate poems, in addition to some pamphlets about his personal affairs“.\n\nThe Bibliographic Dictionary of Inocencio, which provided almost all these notes to Dr. Azevedo, lists the booklets published by Arsenio Pompilio and says that he was born on February 20, 1792. In the 'Notes for a dictionary of notable Portuguese of my time', written by Julio Cesar Machado, there is a long and very interesting article about Pompeu do Carpo.",
