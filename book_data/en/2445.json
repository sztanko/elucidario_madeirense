    "body": "A century ago, there was a significant emigration of Madeirans to British Guiana, with many settling in the city of Georgetown. Among them was João António de Nóbrega, a native of the parish of Monte, who took the initiative to found the first Catholic church in that city, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. He left his name associated with this great endeavor, earning the highest praise from the entire Portuguese colony in that British possession. João António de Nóbrega passed away in Georgetown on March 20, 1912.",
