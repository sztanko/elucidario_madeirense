    "body": "This name is applied in Madeira and Porto Santo to the young individuals of the blacktail seabream and sometimes the red porgy (see these names). When the first of these fish reaches a certain stage of development, it is called 'peixe anique', and only when it is fully grown is it called 'goraz'. The adult 'goraz' seeks the depths, while the young individuals, the 'garapaus', live near the coast, where they are caught by amateur fishermen using a line.\n\nAs is well known, there is no analogy between the 'garapaus' of Madeira and the 'carapaus' of Portugal, the latter name being used to refer to the young individuals of the horse mackerel (see this name), a species also found in the seas that bathe the Peninsula.",
