    "body": "The renowned writer and poet Bulhão Pato was a close friend of the second Count of Carvalhal and spent several seasons on this island in his company. He refers to this in some of his books with the most vivid and nostalgic memories. In the book 'Sob os Ciprestes' and in the three volumes of his Memoirs, he writes about some Madeiran people and things. There are extensive references to the Count of Carvalhal, Jacinto de Sant'Ana e Vasconcelos, Viscountess das Nogueiras, Jaime Moniz, Luiz da Costa Pereira, and others. In cantos VI and VII of his poem 'Paquita', Bulhão Pato beautifully describes Madeira poetically. Bulhão Pato stayed on this island from August 7, 1850, to March 6, 1851.",
