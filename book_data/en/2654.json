    "body": "The most common in Madeira are the *Papaver Rhoeas* and the *P. somniferum*, the latter with white flowers and the former with red flowers. By treading on the capsules of the *P. somniferum* or making superficial incisions, a juice known as opium is obtained, which is one of the most precious remedies in medicine. Morphine is the most active component of opium. The capsules of the white poppy are used in decoction as an anodyne medicine; the petals of the red poppy are soothing, expectorant, and diaphoretic. Opium extraction has never been attempted in Madeira.",
