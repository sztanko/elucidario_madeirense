    "body": "This was the name, before the proclamation of the Republic, of the street on the left bank of the Ribeira de Santa Luzia, now known by the name Rua 31 de Janeiro. It seems that the Municipal Council wanted to pay homage to Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of Prince D. Jo達o, later D. Jo達o VI, when it gave that public road the name it kept until 1910. The people used to call Rua 31 de Janeiro the street of the Trees, because of the beautiful plane trees planted there.",
