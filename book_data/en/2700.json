    "body": "A fish of the Labridae family, not very common in the waters of the archipelago. It is a beautiful species due to its bright red color, but its taste does not match the beauty of its scales. It prefers rocky bottoms, moving along the coast, and is caught at depths of up to about 150 fathoms.",
