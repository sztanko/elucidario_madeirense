    "body": "Luiz Cadamosto was a famous Venetian navigator who served Portugal, having made two voyages to the western coasts of Africa, the narrative of which he wrote and which is considered a valuable element for the history of our maritime discoveries. Cadamosto's Navigations were first published in Italian in 1507, and later in Latin. The Portuguese translation was first published in 1812 in the collection of news for history and geography. Pinheiro Chagas extensively discusses the value and importance of these Navigations. They are of interest to the history of Madeira because Cadamosto dedicates a few pages to this archipelago, being the oldest narrative of so many navigators who have dealt with Madeira. In the Heraldo da Madeira of January 5, 9, and 11, 1906, excerpts from the Navigations were transcribed, in which Cadamosto refers to his stay in Madeira and Porto Santo, having anchored in the port of the latter island on March 25, 1445, and on the 28th of the same month in the bay of Machico. Pinheiro Chagas notes the year 1455 as the year of the Venetian navigator's voyage, and Dr. Azevedo in a note to his article Madeira from the Dicc. Port. Univ. III., adopts the date of 1445, based on arguments he presents. Dr. Pestana JÃºnior, in his valuable study on the Recognition of the Archipelago of Madeira, places Cadamosto's voyages in the years 1449 and 1450.",
