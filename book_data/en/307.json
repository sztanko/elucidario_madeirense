    "body": "He was a native of the parish of Santa Cruz and we believe he belonged to the noble Freitas family, which had Gonçalo de Freitas as its founder on this island. We know little about his biography, but given the important positions he held, we must assume that he was a man of unquestionable merit. He was a religious of the Benedictine order and held the high position of general of the monastery of Alcobaça, which at that time was only held by a person qualified in letters and virtues, with special privileges and prerogatives inherent to this position, and also jurisdiction over all the religious houses of that order in Portugal. He was a deputy of the inquisition in Coimbra and composed some works in Latin and Portuguese, which are mentioned in the Bibliotheca Lusitana. He died in 1654.",
