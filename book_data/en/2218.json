    "body": "He was a doctor of medicine from the University of Edinburgh, having started his medical studies in Paris. He visited Madeira in 1834 due to a pulmonary condition he was suffering from, but as he did not find the improvement he expected here, he changed climate and eventually passed away in Nice the following year, at the age of 27. Works: *A Treatise on the Climate and Meteorology of Madeira*. In this valuable work for many reasons, which only saw the light of publicity in 1850, the author intended to prove that the climate of Funchal was more humid than that of London and its surroundings!",
