    "body": "The Pico das Torres, consisting of different rocky and steep mountains, the highest of which is the Pico do Gato, is a short distance from Pico Ruivo, although separated from it by a deep ravine. To reach it, one takes the lombo do Fur√£o and the ribeira do Gato, but the path is very poor and sometimes passes along the edge of frightful precipices. The Pico do Gato, the highest in Madeira after Pico Ruivo, which is said to be about 1,830 meters high, can be said to be known only to shepherds, as it is very difficult to climb due to its steep slopes, where there are no traces of paths. We heard from some men from Curral who accompanied us to Pico Ruivo and the foot of Pico das Torres, that at the top of Pico do Gato, an English lady was, who, to reach it, had to be tied up and pulled by ropes in the most rugged places, by the Madeiran guides she had with her. It is stated in a guide to Madeira, written in German, that in 1905, the Pico do Gato was visited by two individuals of Russian origin, relatives of the author of the same guide, but we have no knowledge of any exploration made at that high point of the island by national or foreign men of science.",
