He was born in Funchal in 1835 and held various public positions in the mainland and overseas. He was a journalist and contributed to *Jornal do Porto, Verdade, Ecco Popular, Nacional, Alemtejano,* and *Jardim Literario.* He wrote a booklet entitled 'Vida do Visconde de Almeida Garrett, prince of poets in the 19th century.'",
