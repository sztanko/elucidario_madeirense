It is rare to find a countrywoman who does not know how to medicate herself when affected by certain uterine ailments, and it is also rare to find one who does not know one or more remedies that are effective in treating various minor ailments that frequently affect children and adults. There are healers who skillfully reduce a dislocation, and many educated individuals have benefited from the advice and indications of these women, most of whom are illiterate, but some of whom cannot be denied a certain skill and experience in the art of treating a certain number of illnesses.\n\nWe will now provide some information on how certain ailments are treated in the countryside of Madeira, leaving much to be said on the subject, which is worthy of study by those who, due to the specialty of their knowledge, are better able than us to judge the advantages or disadvantages of using certain medicinal agents.\n\n### Sandflies\nThe infusion of St. John's wort yields good results in the treatment of this ailment, provided that the patient consumes little meat, wine, and brandy.\n\n### Asthma\nTo combat this ailment, they give the patients broth made from snails or pigeon excrement.\n\n### Bronchitis, coughs, and colds\nThese are treated with bee honey and hot infusions of ground ivy, sage, eucalyptus, hyssop, marrubium, mullein, borage, wild thyme, fennel seeds, and coriander seeds.

(See *Asthma*).\n\n> *Skin rashes and other skin ailments*\nThe medicines used to combat skin ailments are: internally, infusions of molarinha, heartsease, sorrel, stinging nettle, teijeira, shepherd's purse, and walnut leaves; and externally, petroleum, seawater, and somewhat caustic juices of celandine and butcher's broom. The use of sublimated sulfur is becoming more widespread, and to soothe itchy eczema, hot water applied to the affected area gives excellent results.\nAsh and spit are considered useful in the treatment of skin rashes, and it is customary to accompany their application with the following words: Rash, little rash, why did you come here?

A cup of black tea is sufficient in some cases to make digestive disturbances disappear, caused by poor quality or quantity of food.\nA glass of very hot water, drunk on an empty stomach, is said to be very useful in dyspepsia and stomach pains, and linseed poultices are also useful in these pains, which can also disappear with the simple application of a properly heated baize cloth or a slice of bread soaked in hot wine.\n\n> *Neuralgia*\nThey are treated by applying a hot baize cloth or a mustard plaster to the painful area.

With mother laurel brandy, cinnamon, rue buds, fennel, and two to three cloves, a very commonly used medicine is prepared internally for uterine ailments. The infusion of chard, basil, and coltsfoot is also used for the same purpose, as well as that of wormwood and other emmenagogue plants. Rosemary, lavender, basil, coltsfoot, Our Lady's rosemary, etc., are used in baths or washes, and with rue and lavender or rosemary mashed, a beaten egg and a little flour, a poultice is made that has a stimulating action on the uterus. A half glass of brandy calms the pains that often accompany menstruation.\n\n> Burns\n\nThey are treated with egg white, fresh urine, milk cream, and olive oil with a pinch of fine salt.\n\n> Rickets\n\nChildren suffering from this ailment are placed in grape must inside the wine presses.\n\n> Urinary retention and other urinary tract affections\n\nThe Madeirans combat these ailments with warm baths, linseed poultices, and infusions of stonecrop, coltsfoot, mugwort, corn silk, cherry peduncles, water lentil, St. John's wort, English peach tree, etc..\n\n> Rheumatism\n\nSulfur and petroleum applied externally, massage, mustard plasters, rubs with brandy, warm wine, or camphorated alcohol, washes with rosemary or broom decoction, and baths with salt water, are somewhat advantageous in the treatment of rheumatism. We are told that some people have been cured of this ailment by using petroleum applied with a chicken feather.

Crushed garlic is sometimes used against worms.\n\n> Warts\n\nThey are made to disappear by applying salt or the yellow and caustic juice of celandine, a plant that is common in Madeira. Many people believe that for the salt to take effect, it should be thrown into the fire after rubbing it on the wart. Much later than the publication (in 1921) of this information about rural medicine in this archipelago, the Viscount of PÃ´rto da Cruz published a pamphlet entitled \"The Madeiran Flora in Folk Medicine\".",
