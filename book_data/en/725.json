    "body": "A bird of the Fringilida family, common in all these islands. It does not migrate on long voyages over the open sea, but moves according to the seasons and other circumstances, within the same island or between two nearby islands. It is a bird peculiar to the Macaronesian archipelagos, that is, the Azores, Madeira, and the Canaries, from which the highly esteemed canary bird originates; however, it is not known to have been observed in the Savage Islands. The brood consists of 3 to 5 eggs, speckled with more or less dark violet on a bluish-green background. It is easily domesticated, and in some uninhabited islets or islands of the archipelago, the most remarkable forms are found with bright yellow plumage.",
