    "body": "It is a cave near Pico Ruivo where people who visit this mountain usually spend the night. It is wide but not very deep, so it provides little protection from the winds and rains that come from the sides of Curral das Freiras. It takes about 20 minutes from the cave to the top of the peak. In its vicinity, in 1940, the Tourism Delegation built a 'pousada' for shelter and rest for those who climb that eminence. See Ruivo (Pico).",
