    "body": "This plant, from the family Ternstroemiaceae, was introduced to Madeira in the first quarter of the 19th century by the English consul Henrique Veitch, who cultivated it in his estate in Jardim da Serra while he was alive. Thirty years ago, there were still some tea plants in this estate. Consul Veitch only produced black tea. The difference between black and green teas arises from the fact that in the preparation of the former, the leaves are finally dried in sieves over a coal-fed fire, whereas in the latter, the drying is done in an iron vessel. According to Mr. Gabriel de Almeida, the most suitable terrains for the growth of the shrub that produces tea are the slopes of the mountains, inclined, humid, fresh, and rich in humus, with the added advantage of being away from the coast, as the same shrub is very sensitive to the sea salt brought by the winds.",
