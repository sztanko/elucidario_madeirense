    "body": "In the article *Judicial Administration*, we mentioned that in 1767, the decree of August 2, 1766, which created the positions of judge outside and magistrate in the Azores, was applied to Madeira. These positions in the Madeiran archipelago began to be held by two magistrates, whereas before that date they were held by a single individual. The application of the decree of August 2, 1766 only made the exercise of the two positions permanent, which also became definitively carried out by two magistrates. The two positions of judge outside and magistrate have been very old among us, but they were not permanent and were sometimes held by the same individual. In the archive of the Funchal City Council, many appointment diplomas for each position are registered, the oldest being from 1512, in favor of Rui Pires as judge outside, and from 1466 in favor of Denis Anes de Aragão as magistrate. Subsequently, although with some interruptions in the exercise of the position, the following individuals served as judge outside: Pedro Fernandes (1554), Lourenço Correia (1558), Pedro Anes (1566), Pedro Barbosa (1567), Lourenço da Cunha Macedo (1573), Francisco de Sousa (1645), Antonio de Sousa Galvão (1649), Manuel de Sena Tenreiro (1657), Antonio Freire Cardoso (1657), Manuel Soares Monteiro (1662), António Martins Machado (1681), Manuel de Sequeira e Gouveia (1685), Manuel Viegas (1689), Francisco Gomes de Góis (1691), Manuel de Sousa Teixeira (1695), Nuno de Afonseca Homem (1698), Antonio de Macedo (1702), Vital Casado Rotier (1705), Antonio da Costa Maciel (1709), Antonio da Cunha Franco (1714), João de Andrade Albuquerque (1717), Feliciano Prestes de Gouveia (1722), Sebastião Mendes de Carvalho (1730), Manuel Vieira Cardoso (1733), José Barquette de Oliveira (1739), Miguel de Arriaga Brun Silveira (1747), Luís Antonio de Sousa Tavares e Abreu (1763), Antonio Felipe Bulhões (1766), Francisco Alvares de Andrade (1770), Bernardo José de Oliveira Perdigão (1779), Antonio Rodrigues Veloso de Oliveira (1784), José Maria Cardoso Soeiro (1790), Antonio Felipe Ferreira Cabral (1798), José Julio Henriques Gordilho (1802), Manuel Caetano de Almeida Albuquerque (1808), José Joaquim Nabuco de Araújo (1812), Luis Ribeiro de Sousa Saraiva (1819), Joaquim de Assis Saldanha (1821), Antonio Joaquim de Carvalho (1823), Manuel Ferreira Seabra da Mota (1826), and Manuel Cirilo Esperança Freire (1828), who was the last and served until June 14, 1834. The judge outside was the natural president of the Funchal Municipal Council and only exercised functions within the term, which was a subdivision of the District. In his absence, he was replaced by the oldest councilor, who was then called a judge by the law, and had a pension paid by the Council. Both he and the magistrate had to be law graduates.\n\n## See\nJudicial Administration.",
