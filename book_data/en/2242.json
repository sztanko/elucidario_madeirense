    "body": "The French frigate Medusa, well known for its shipwreck on the Arguin Bank, 40 leagues off the coast of Africa, and for the immeasurable sufferings endured by many of its crew and passengers after abandoning the ship, passed by Madeira on June 28, 1816, but did not make contact with the land. The frigate was commanded by Duroy de Chaumareys, whose stubbornness and incompetence led to the death of more than 150 people who had embarked on it in Aix, destined for the French establishments on the west coast of Africa. The shipwreck occurred on July 2, 1816.",
