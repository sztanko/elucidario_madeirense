    "body": "Located in the parish of Santo Antonio. The invocation of this chapel is Nossa Senhora do Pópulo, but no one knows it by this name, commonly being called Pico do Cardo or Quinta dos Padres. This denomination comes from its location and the residence that the Jesuits had there. We do not know the year of its foundation, but we presume it is not earlier than the first quarter of the 18th century. The Jesuits acquired this property between the years 1635 and 1714 and built the house and chapel there, which in 1770, along with the adjacent lands, were sold at public auction for seven contos de réis. This small chapel, which has a hexagonal shape and is almost contiguous to the residential house, is in good condition and divine services are celebrated there.\n\nIn the articles related to the blessed Inácio de Azevedo, Jesuits, and the chapel of Pópulo, published in the Parochia de Santo António do Funchal magazine, there is more extensive information about the subjects touched upon in this brief article.",
