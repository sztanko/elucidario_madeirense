    "body": "Shrub of the Solanaceae family and apparently native to America, widely cultivated in Madeira. Its ovate-oblong or ovate-conical, red fruits are stimulating and used as a seasoning in kitchens. The Capsicum baccatum, with small, globular fruits, appears in some gardens in Funchal and is known on the island by the name of malagueta. The black, round seeds that the Madeirans call pimenta de fora come from the Piper migrum, a climbing shrub of the Piperaceae family, unknown in Madeira but common in India, China, Java, Borneo, etc.",
