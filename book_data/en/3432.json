    "body": "Amphibious reptile of the subclass of chelonians, which appears in the seas near Madeira and whose meat is appreciated by the Madeirans, although it is less tasty than that of the tropical turtle. Its eggs have never been found in Madeira or Porto Santo, so it is assumed that the animal deposits them in the sands of some islands of Cape Verde. Fishermen capture the turtle when they find it sleeping on the surface of the ocean.",
