    "body": "In 1460, Rui Mendes Pereira, also known as Tacâo, came to Madeira and married twice on the island, as stated by Dr. Azevedo. Many people in our island carry the surname Pereira due to their descent from him. This surname has various origins and is widespread. An interesting article titled 'The Pereiras of D. Nuno Alvares' was published in issue no. 33 of the newspaper *a Informaçâo* on August 13, 1931 (Funchal). The article aims to prove that the great Constable Nuno Alvares Pereira, now beatified by the Catholic Church, had a large extended family on this island spread across different parishes. The article makes a curious reference: 'we see that the Pereiras of the Constable abundantly mixed with the people of Madeira. In the labyrinth of genealogical connections, the blood of Nuno Alvares stands out in almost the entire population, not only in noble families, but also in those of the common people, as both, over time, have merged in the slow social evolution.' This phenomenon can be affirmed to have occurred intensely in Madeira with all families, whether of noble or common origin, coming from the Portuguese mainland.",
