    "body": "The port of this locality is served by a beach of large pebbles, making it not very easy for embarkation and disembarkation, especially when the waves are agitated, necessitating the construction of a pier, which was carried out in the period from 1904 to 1908. It is located to the east of the town, to which it is connected by a tunnel and a small road, providing good services to this parish, the surrounding villages, and even to some locations in the north of the island. Steamers of the coastal service call at this port.",
