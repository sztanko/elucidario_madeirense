    "body": "This small Fajã is located on the south coast of Madeira, a little beyond Cabo Girão. At the bottom, there is a large, bare rock about 300 meters high, and its population is around 50 inhabitants who spiritually obey the church of S. Braz in the parish of Campanário.\n\nFajã dos Padres, which belonged in other times to the Jesuit priests and where there are still traces of a chapel perhaps built by them, was the property of Colonel Manuel J. de França Doria. After cultivating sugarcane on his land without much success, he re-established the cultivation of vines, which seems to be the best suited to the local soil.\n\nThe best Malvasia wine produced on the island used to come from Fajã dos Padres, where the Sercial and other high-quality grape varieties were also cultivated.",
