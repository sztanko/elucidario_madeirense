Isabel Telo. He held the position of treasurer of D. Manuel in Madeira when he was the Duke of Beja and Grand Master of the Order of Christ. This Luiz de Atouguia or one of his close descendants had sesmaria lands in the parish of Calheta, in the place still called Lombo do Atouguia, which he named. Coat of arms: 'On a red field quartered with a gold cross formed from the field, and in each quarter a gold fleur-de-lis; the same border, crest a rising gold lion.'",
