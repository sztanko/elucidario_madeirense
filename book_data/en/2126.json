    "body": "There are many valuable elements scattered in various printed works and some unpublished ones, in addition to the documentation recorded in public archives, which would provide the essential materials for the elaboration of a brief historical study about the Madeiran archipelago, which, in a summarized framework and in a comprehensive synthesis, would give us a report of the main phases of its already long active life of five centuries, from the beginning of the primitive settlement to the present time. In just over a hundred pages, this interesting outline would be drawn, which is entirely yet to be done, and it is enough to feel that no one has yet endeavored to do it. We have already outlined this subject more extensively in the article 'Madeiran History', on pages 124-127 of this volume, to which we refer the reader. The articles 'Bibliography' and 'Elements for Madeiran History', included on pages 143 and 386 of volume 1 of this work, Madeira in the Torre do Tombo, as well as many other articles, have a close affinity with this subject.",
