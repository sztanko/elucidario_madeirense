    "body": "In the 'Saudades da Terra' in various articles, chronicles, and in many nobility records, there are numerous references to Madeirans who distinguished themselves in the squares of Morocco, notably in the attacks against the Moors. Particularly worthy of mention are the prompt and valuable aid sent from this island when the same squares were threatened and in danger of being destroyed by the warlike supporters of Mohammed. The lords of Funchal organized several expeditions, some of them well equipped and supplied, and at no cost to the metropolis, which rendered the most remarkable services to the Homeland. In some scattered articles of this work, and especially in the pamphlet 'Madeira and the African Squares' authored by Colonel Alberto Artur Sarmento, there are several pieces of information that are relevant to this subject.",
