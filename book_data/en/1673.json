    "body": "German biologist born in 1834 and passed away on August 10, 1919. He visited Madeira in 1866 and in the Natural History of Creation, he discusses the rabbit of Porto Santo, considering it as a distinct species from the European rabbit. As we mentioned on page 283 of this Elucid√°rio, such an opinion has no basis whatsoever. It is worth adding now that the doctrines of the wise professor from the University of Jena are discredited among all men of science, with Professor Yves Delage declaring them as 'an execrable hodgepodge, unworthy of naturalists of our time'.",
