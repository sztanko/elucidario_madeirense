    "body": "On August 23, 1849, the Russian navy frigate Kamtchatka anchored in our port, carrying on board Prince Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg, brother of Prince August, the first husband of Queen Maria II, and of Queen Amelia, widow of King Pedro IV. The ship had to undergo quarantine, and the prince was only able to disembark on August 27, receiving a splendid reception prepared by the then civil governor, the benefactor counselor José Silvestre Ribeiro.\n\nThe prince visited many parishes in Madeira and also went to Porto Santo, being an enthusiastic admirer of the natural beauty of our archipelago. He stayed on the island until April 23, 1850, when he embarked for Russia. He left us with the most pleasant memories, not only for his extreme affability but also for the charitable feelings he eloquently demonstrated in favor of the poor in our land.\n\nDuke of Leuchtenberg, son of the famous Prince Eugenio Napoleon and son-in-law of the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas I, had come to Madeira in search of relief for his sufferings and, upon leaving, declared, amidst convulsive weeping, that he had spent some of the happiest and most peaceful days of his entire life here.\n\nHis entourage consisted of Prince Pierre Bagratin, Count Ojarowski, Captain Pauchine, Secretary Eugène Mussar, Doctor S. Fischer, and fifteen servants.\n\nHe resided at the Quinta das Angústias, where Queen Adelaide of England had also previously resided, and where Princess D. Maria Amelia died in 1853. He visited Porto Santo in 1850, traveling to the island on the Russian frigate Palas.\n\nA son of Prince Maximilian, Prince Nicolau Maximilian, also Duke of Leuchtenberg, visited Madeira in 1886, arriving at the port of Funchal on December 1 and disembarking the following day. He was given the military honors to which he was entitled, as a prince related to the royal houses of Portugal and Russia.\n\nPrince Nicolau spent part of the year 1887 in Madeira, departing for Europe on June 16.",
