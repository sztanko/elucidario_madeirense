    "body": "A fish of the eel family, very rare in the waters of Madeira, where it has been caught with a line in deep water. It is distinguished from the common conger, among other characteristics, by the large size of its eyes and by the less consistent and somewhat watery flesh. In Machico, it is called 'congra,' or rather 'cronga,' by corruption.",
