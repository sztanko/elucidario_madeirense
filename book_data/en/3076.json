    "body": "It is one of the three streams that cross the city and has this name because, on an eminence of its left bank, the chapel of this invocation was situated. Its marginal lands were among the first to be subjected to various agricultural exploitations in the early times of colonization. On its banks, there were in the late 17th century, four sugar mills. In the hydrographic basin of this stream, important levadas are born, the main one being the so-called Santa Luzia levada (See II-255).",
