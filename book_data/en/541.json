    "body": "Of the species that provide rubber, only Ficus elastica of the Urticaceae family and Manihot Glaziovii of the Euphorbiaceae family exist in Madeira. The former is found in several estates in Funchal; the latter, as far as we know, only exists in the lands adjacent to the Disinfection Post, in Campo da Barca, where it thrives. In many locations on the island, there is a Composite, called mistletoe, whose latex solidifies into a whitish and elastic mass, but it has no industrial applications.",
