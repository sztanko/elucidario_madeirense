He was one of the first settlers of this island and married Brites Gonçalves da Câmara, the second daughter of João Gonçalves Zarco. Diogo Cabral built the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Estrela in Calheta, which had been designed by Zarco, and whose construction he had strongly recommended to his sons. Cabral had many sesmaria lands there, which were donated to him by his father-in-law. He died on December 15, 1486, and is buried in the chapel he built. He was the grandfather of Tristão Vaz da Veiga. He was the first in this island to use the surname Cabral.\n\nCoat of arms of the Cabrais: two goats walking adorned in purple and black; crest: one of the goats from the shield.",
