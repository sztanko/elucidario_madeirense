    "body": "Large marine animal, extremely detested by Madeiran fishermen and a fierce enemy of tuna, which it fiercely pursues, either by tightly encircling them or causing them to scatter, according to fishermen who have observed it closely. The passage of such animals through the fishing grounds is naturally a just cause for opposition to the fisherman and even for causing him enormous damage, as it is from the tuna fishery that he hopes to obtain the best compensation for the toils and dangers of his risky life. To this day, this species has not been conclusively identified. It is supposed, however, to be not a fish, but a cetacean Orca gladiator, which among the fishermen of the Algarve is called ruaz de bandeira, and is no less feared there for the serious damage it causes to the tuna gear.",
