    "body": "This Madeiran lady, who has long resided outside this island, cultivated literature among us with brilliance and justified reputation. She collaborated in various newspapers, and in 1877 she wrote a drama entitled Aldo or the Daughter of the Sea, which was performed in this city and received the highest applause from the audience. The main scenes of this drama were published in a newspaper in Funchal. Speaking of D. Olimpia Fernandes, a brilliant culture of literature said: 'I have read with interest all the other productions of the distinguished writer, and unless I am very mistaken, she will one day occupy one of the first places among the ladies who cultivate literature.' We do not know if D. Olimpia Fernandes continued to cultivate literature and if she may have published other writings, as was expected from her talent and erudition.",
