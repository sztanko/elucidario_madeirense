    "body": "We have knowledge of this Madeiran through the references found about him in volumes X and XI of the Bibliographic Dictionary by Inocencio. He was born in Funchal on January 28, 1818, and died in Nictheroy, Brazil, on June 2, 1871. In 1809, he accompanied his father to Rio de Janeiro and there pursued a course in piano and singing. He belonged to various societies and in that city, he founded one aimed at providing free education. He published a booklet entitled Breve compêndio de musica, dedicated to his serene highness the imperial princess D. Leopoldina. It seems that he left several unpublished works intended for the study of music, but of which we have no knowledge.",
