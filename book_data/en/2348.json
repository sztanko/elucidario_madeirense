    "body": "Born in Funchal on August 25, 1773, he was the son of Pedro Jorge Monteiro and D. Maria Teresa de Gusmão, and the brother of the mineralogist Dr. João António Monteiro (see this name). He was a prominent merchant in Lisbon when the revolution broke out in Porto on August 24, 1821, and had its echo in the capital on September 15 of the same year. After the death of D. João VI, D. Pedro was proclaimed king of Portugal and granted the Constitutional Charter. Elections for deputies were held, and Luís Monteiro was elected as a representative for Madeira, but he never took his seat in the national representation. Luís Monteiro carried out some public service commissions and in 1834 was entrusted with a mission to our legation in London.",
