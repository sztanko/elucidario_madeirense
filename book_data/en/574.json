    "body": "D. Estevão Brioso or D. Estevão Brioso de Figueiredo, as his name is also found written, was the 121st bishop of Funchal from 1685 to 1689. He was born in the city of Évora, the son of Manuel Martins and Catarina de Figueiredo. He was a secular cleric and graduated in canons from the University of Coimbra. He held the position of vicar general of the archdiocese of Lisbon when the diocese of Pernambuco was created in 1676, and he was presented as bishop, taking office in 1678. The difficulties he faced in his bishopric in enforcing ecclesiastical discipline forced him to leave the position, returning to the mainland kingdom a few years later. In 1684, he was appointed bishop of Funchal, assuming the government of the diocese in April 1685. Four years later, due to health reasons, he had to leave for the capital, where he died on May 20, 1689, and was buried in the church of the College of São Patrício. We are unaware of any facts or circumstances that marked his time in the diocese of Funchal.",
