    "body": "Two plants of the Verbenaceae family are known by this name: Verbena bonarbensis and V. officinalis. The first, which is native to South America, has very rough, incised-serrated leaves and lilac-colored flowers arranged in spikes, which are initially short and then elongated; the second, which is indigenous, has incised-serrated or pinnatifid leaves, sometimes glabrescent on the upper side, and very small blue flowers arranged in narrow spikes that become filiform in fruiting. The infusion of the leaves of these plants is used for liver and kidney ailments. Jarv達o is a corruption of urgeb達o.",
