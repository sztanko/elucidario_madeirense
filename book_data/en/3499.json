    "body": "This is the name of the small square and the bridge that communicates with it, not being a name known in Madeira's toponymy. In the place where the Torreão Bridge now stands, or perhaps in its nearest vicinity, there was a wooden bridge that connected with the Torrinha Path, and the numerous pilgrims who were heading to the chapel, and since 1565, the parish church of Nossa Senhora do Monte, used to transit through it. The current Monte Path was only opened to the public, with the route it now preserves, in the early 19th century. Diogo Forjaz Coutinho, who was one of the most illustrious governors of Madeira, had a new and solid masonry bridge built there, and a curious and picturesque stone inscription was placed on one of the parapets of the bridge, which is preserved in the atrium of the Municipal Museum and which we will transcribe verbatim:\n\n> Stop, passerby, stop.\n> When you go up to Monte\n> And admire on the way\n> The well-made bridge\n> By the great Forjas Coutinho\n> In the year 1787.\n\nIt was later widened, as the current movement of passersby and cargo transportation in that location demanded. In its vicinity is the well-known Torreão Factory, the most important industrial establishment among us, which has always been a great element of prosperity for our agricultural industry, reflecting remarkably in all aspects of Madeiran life.",
