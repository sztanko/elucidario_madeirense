    "body": "He was, with his father, in the battle of Alcacer-Quibir, where he was wounded and taken prisoner. Having managed to return to his homeland, he followed the party of the Prior do Crato, to whom he rendered relevant services, and died gloriously in the famous naval battle of Vila Franca do Campo, on July 26, 1582. He was the 7th lord of Machico and the 2nd Count of Vimioso, because it was only a long time after the disaster of Alcacer-Quibir that it was known that D. Afonso de Portugal did not die in the battle and was a prisoner of the Moors in Africa. The captaincy of Machico was given by Philip II to Trist√£o Vaz da Veiga, still during the lifetime of the 2nd Count of Vimioso.",
