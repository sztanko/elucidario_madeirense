    "body": "Since the time of the grantees, there have been corregedores in Madeira, but only from 1767 onwards was there a permanent corregedor here. He was the first judicial officer and his jurisdiction extended throughout the archipelago. He had a pension provided by the council and was replaced in his impediments by the judge from outside, and in the absence of the latter, by the oldest councilor. With the execution in this district, on October 15, 1835, of the judicial reform of May 16, 1832, the corregedores disappeared, being replaced by judges of law.",
