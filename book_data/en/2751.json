    "body": "European Pyrus Marus subesp. hortensis, usually a shrub, widely cultivated in Madeira. The apple tree is one of the many horticultural varieties of this species, easily distinguished from the pear tree by its flattened and more finely textured and pleasant-tasting pomes. The best apples come from Camacha, Santo Antonio da Serra, and other high-altitude locations on the island, while pears are found everywhere, some of them quite tasty when ripe. The pear-vine, the pear-stalk, the sweet pear, the barrel apple, the reinette apple, the bed-face apple, and the golden pine apple are the most well-known varieties in Madeira. In the past, a lot of wine was made from the juice or must of pears or apples, which was sold to consumers as grape wine; today, the vinification of these fruits is prohibited, but cider, a pleasant beverage consumed in many countries, can be made from them.",
