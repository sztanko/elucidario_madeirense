    "body": "A woody plant of the Labiatae family, easily recognizable by its purple flowers arranged in verticillasters gathered in clusters, and by its crenate or serrated leaves, almost white on the underside. It is common on the north coast and in many valleys of the interior of Madeira. In some parts of the island, it is attributed with medicinal properties, and it may be advantageous to use it as a tonic and stomachic. Wood sage is also known by the name 'white herb.'",
