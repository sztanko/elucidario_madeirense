    "body": "His parents were Captain José Luiz de Freitas Silva Nunes and D. Ana Inacia Caetano Drumond, and he was born in Câmara de Lobos in 1760. He was a law graduate from the University of Coimbra, the first president of the Society of Friends of Sciences and Arts, and held the positions of almotacé, chief health officer, councilor of the Funchal City Council, interim judge, and member of the Lancasterian School board. On October 18, 1803, the Municipal Council decided to commission him to report on the state of the city after the flood of that year, in order to be kept in the archive of the same Council. He published a memoir titled Noticias Mineralogicas da Ilha da Madeira in the Investigador Português and wrote the Apontamentos Historicos e geographicos sobre a ilha da Madeira, of which the original manuscript is in the municipal library, as well as several articles published in the Patriota Funchalense. He was a fervent constitutionalist, a distinguished lawyer, and a very erudite man. He died without descendants in March 1825. He was known among his contemporaries by the nickname Dr. Piolho, due to his short stature.",
