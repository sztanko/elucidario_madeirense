    "body": "A plant of the family Tropaeolaceae, perfectly naturalized in Funchal and its suburbs. It is native to America, and its young fruits, when pickled in vinegar, can replace capers; the English make a salad from its flowers and tender leaves, which can also be used as an antiscorbutic medicine. The true capers are the flower buds of Capparis spinosa, a species unknown in Madeira.",
