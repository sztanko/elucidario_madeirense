    "body": "The port serving this parish and other neighboring parishes has a relatively large movement, and it is quite regrettable that a small pier has not yet been built there, considering the difficulties of access to the narrow cove that limits the site of the town, the only point where the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and goods are allowed. Adjacent to the town, there is a beach of large rounded pebbles that delimits the same port. There are two points where all this movement particularly takes place, the main one being the so-called Rampa and another at the site of Serra de Água, near the mouth of the stream of the same name. Steamers regularly call at these ports for coastal maritime service. The port is respectively 2.3 miles from Fajã do Mar and 2.1 from Jardim do Mar, which are the ports closest to it.",
