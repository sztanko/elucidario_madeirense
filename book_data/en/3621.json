The lookouts were manned by the people, in small strong houses, purposefully built to withstand the sea and prevent surprises. In 1567, D. Sebasti達o regulated them, a regulation that is recorded in volume V, page 105, of the Archive of the Funchal City Council, and, by royal decree of 1569, he determined that no one would be exempt from this service.'",
