    "body": "The 'Jogo das Canas' was widely practiced in Madeira during the time of the donatários, and it was greatly favored by Captain Simão Gonçalves da Câmara, the Conde da Calheta. It is mentioned on page 202 of 'Saudades da Terra' that in 1555, upon returning to Madeira, Antonio Gonçalves da Câmara, accompanied by his second wife D. Margarida de Vila-verde, a lady of the queen, many festivities were held, in which Francisco Leomelim shone, being so skilled in the 'jogo das canas' that 'he did not give a cane, not even in the horse's hooves'. The Moorish game of 'jogo das canas' consisted, according to Pinheiro Chagas, 'in swiftly throwing a light cane, on the rapid gallop of a horse accustomed to this kind of exercise, which the opponent had to avoid, while simultaneously throwing his own'. In the novel *A Filha de Tristão das Damas*, by J. Reis Gomes, there is an interesting account of the 'jogo das canas' in this island.",
