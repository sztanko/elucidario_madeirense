    "body": "A Castilian bishop who was in Madeira in 1548, coming from the Canary Islands. He consecrated the church of the monastery of S. Francisco and confirmed and ordained in the island. He intended to be the bishop of Madeira, for which \"he went to Lisbon, says Frutuoso, with the purpose of asking the King for that bishopric, alleging for this what he had done in it; but His Highness ordered him to be very well satisfied with his work, and his petition was deemed unnecessary, since he was not a native, and there were many in the Kingdom who deserved it\".",
