This privilege did not disappear with the transformation of the Madeira grants into alcaidarias-mores, but it seems that it was little respected in the last times. Therefore, on February 6, 1769, a notice was issued stating that the procurator of the Marquis of Castello Melhor should not be obliged to supply salt to the population, and anyone could unload and sell this product, as was previously practiced.",
