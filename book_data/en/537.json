    "body": "In Madeira, about 120 species of Lepidoptera are known, many of which are known by the designation of butterflies. In gardens and fields, some notable species of diurnal butterflies are frequent due to the colorful nature of their wings, such as Pieris Brassicae, Colias edusa, Lycaena baetica, Vanessa Atalanta, V. Callirhoe, V. Cardui, etc. It is the Pieris Brassicae, with almost white wings, that produces the caterpillar that destroys cabbages.",
