    "body": "He was the commander of the Spanish garrison in Madeira, composed of four companies of salaried troops, at the time of the revolution of December 1, 1640, which placed the Duke of Bragança on the throne of Portugal. Despite being able to oppose the recognition of D. João IV on this island, he did nothing to counter the will of the Madeirans, and even attended the meeting where the acclamation of the new monarch took place, leaving for his country as soon as he had the opportunity, accompanied by the troops under his command.",
