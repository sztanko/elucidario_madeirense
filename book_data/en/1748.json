    "body": "It extends from the Praça dos Lavradores to the southern limit of Rua da Rochinha and the intersection with Travessa do Arcipreste. It is one of the oldest streets in Funchal and was once called Diogo Afonso. Its name comes from the fact that the hospital of Santa Isabel remained there for many years, before its installation in the current building. It was also called Rua de Santo António, a name that many still use today, as a chapel of that invocation was built there, the ruins of which are found on the south side of the same street. Adjacent to the hospital was the old parish church of the parish of Santa Maria Maior.",
