    "body": "About forty years ago, a man with the surname Coelho Mendes, from the Azores, lived in Funchal. In this city, around 1885, he published a volume of poetry titled 'Flores Agrestes', and also published a small pamphlet in a controversy he sustained with the canon Aires Pacheco. Under the title 'Flores Agrestes', João Fortunato de Oliveira had already published a volume of poetry in Funchal in the year 1860, and many years later, in 1903, Manuel Ribeiro also published a small volume of verses with the same title.",
