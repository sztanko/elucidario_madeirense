    "body": "Lord of Fuerte-Ventura and count of Lançarote, was appointed on November 12, 1582, as the general governor of Madeira. He came to this archipelago on the special mission of preparing the military defense of this island against the supposed invasion of the French fleet, which, under the orders of D. António, Prior of Crato, was attacking Portuguese ships and preparing to assault some ports, as later happened in the Azores archipelago. Once the fear of this supposed aggression was dispelled, Herrera left Madeira, and João Leitão resumed the position of general governor (see this name).",
