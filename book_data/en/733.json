    "body": "Tree of the Lauraceae family, originating from Japan and widely cultivated in the estates and gardens of Funchal. It produces the camphor of commerce, which is obtained by putting small pieces of the trunk and branches of the tree in an iron vessel, whose lid must be pierced by rice straws. Through heating, the camphor vaporizes and adheres to the straw, thus producing crude camphor, which has a grayish color. This product gives by sublimation the camphor of the pharmacies. The canforeiro is a good shade tree, with persistent leaves.",
