    "body": "It was Pedro Figueira, a native of the island of Faial and the son of João Figueira and Aldonça Fernandes, who was one of the first to use this surname on this island, having settled here around the year 1500. His son, named Manuel Figueira, established an entail on this island. Dr. Álvaro de Azevedo refers to them as Figueiró, but in several genealogies, we have found the surname Figueira mentioned for the individuals mentioned, with the same commentator of the Saudades adding that he does not know who was the first to introduce this surname on this island. It is certain that Alvaro Figueira was also one of the first settlers of Madeira and had sesmarias in Câmara de Lobos.",
