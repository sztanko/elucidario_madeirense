    "body": "Tree of the Lauraceae family, mainly found in the north of Madeira, where it descends to the vicinity of the sea. It can reach over twenty meters in height and has leathery and sometimes almost opposite leaves, and small flowers arranged in panicles shorter than the leaves. The protuberances often observed on the upper part of the leaves of this tree constitute a cecidia of the Erineum type. The wood of the barbuzano is very little used by carpenters, due to its extreme hardness. On the island of Porto Santo, the name barbuzano is given to the Sideroxylon Marmulano, a species known in Madeira by the name of marmulano.",
