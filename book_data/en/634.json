    "body": "There are twenty-six docks in Madeira distributed along the north and south coasts, almost all of them built or improved by the General Board from 1905 to 1916. Thanks to the construction of these docks, embarkation and disembarkation are now quite easy in many parts of the island, and it is desirable that others be built not only in Madeira but also in Porto Santo, so that the inconveniences to which people visiting certain points of the coast of the two islands are subjected may disappear. These works, although sometimes expensive, more than compensate for the sacrifices they entail, as they provide great benefits to the people, facilitating communications between the various parishes of the archipelago.\n\nThe information presented below is a brief summary of everything we know about the docks of Madeira.",
