    "body": "A tree from the Rutaceae family, originating from the Himalayas. Its botanical name is Citrus Aurantium, and the two subspecies cultivated on the island are: amara, known as bitter orange tree, and sinensis, known as sweet or Chinese orange tree. The sweet oranges produced in Madeira are almost always inferior to those from Portugal and SÃ£o Miguel. The leaves and flowers of orange trees are used in infusion for nervous disorders and difficult digestion. The bitter orange tree, most commonly used in medicine and little cultivated in Madeira, and its fruits, which were once sold very cheaply, can only be eaten as preserves. The tangerines or mandarin oranges are produced by Citrus nobilis, a species native to China, cultivated in many gardens in Funchal.",
