    "body": "He was a friar of the Order of Christ, to which the archipelago of Madeira belonged spiritually (see Order of Christ). He was one of the first priests that, at the request of Infante D. Henrique, the Order of Christ sent to this island, having broader canonical jurisdiction than the other clergymen who were in Madeira at that time. He performed parish functions in Nossa Senhora do Calhau and later became the parish priest of the Sé parish, being invested in the position of dean of the Cathedral when this diocese was created in 1514. He represented the Order of Christ and therefore performed supervisory and oversight functions over various branches of public administration, leaving behind an honorable memory.",
