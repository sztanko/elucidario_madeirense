    "body": "Aníbal Alvares da Silva was born in Funchal on May 29, 1819, the son of Vitorino Alvares da Silva. He soon established his residence in the then town of Setúbal, where his father held the position of chief customs officer. After completing his law degree with remarkable success, he settled in his adopted homeland as a lawyer, achieving great influence in Setúbal due to his rare talent, austere character, and other commendable qualities. He served as the president of the municipality and was elected as a deputy several times. He rendered invaluable services to that locality, which holds him in high esteem as a great benefactor, and there are plans to erect a monument to his memory there. He died in Lisbon, where he practiced law with great renown, on December 8, 1408.",
