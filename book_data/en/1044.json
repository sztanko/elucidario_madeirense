    "body": "This Brazilian priest, who was the owner of a large fortune, died in Funchal on January 9, 1912. Shortly before his death, he made verbal dispositions of his possessions in Brazil and Goa. The last dispositions of his will were contested, leading to a judicial process on the matter in Brazilian courts. The pamphlet \"Uma questão de direito internacional\" (A question of international law), published in Lisbon in 1913 by its author Dr. Vicente Ferrer, deals with the stay and death of Monsenhor Hipolito Costa in Funchal.",
