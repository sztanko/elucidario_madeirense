    "body": "From the annual publication prepared and edited by the 'Junta Autónoma dos Portos do Arquipélago da Madeira', we transcribe the table of the sunrise and sunset in Funchal for the current year of 1944. Although this note does not constitute a permanent indication, it is of particular interest due to its close approximation to reality, and can provide a valuable service to those who wish to consult it. When it is not easy to obtain a calculation formulated with all mathematical accuracy, it is often advantageous to obtain a notion that, as far as possible, approximates the truth.\n\n## Here is the table, calculated every ten days: \nMonths Days Sunrise Sunset\nh m h m\nJanuary 1 7.08 17.14\n11 7.09 17.22\n21 7.08 17.31\n31 7.03 17.40\n10 6.55 17.50\nFebruary 20 6.48 17.57\n1 6.35 18.06\nMarch 11 6.24 18.13\n21 6.10 18.21\n31 5.58 18.27\nApril 10 5.45 18.34\n20 5.33 18.42\n30 5.23 18.48\nMay 10 5.14 18.55\n20 5.07 19.02\n30 5.04 19.08\nJune 9 5.01 19.13\n19 5.02 19.16\n29 5.04 19.18\nJuly 9 5.09 19.16\n19 5.15 19.13\n29 5.21 19.06\nAugust 8 5.28 18.58\n18 5.35 18.48\n28 5.40 18.37\nSeptember 7 5.47 18.24\n17 5.53 18.11\n27 5.59 18.58\nOctober 7 6.06 17.45\n17 6.12 17.33\n27 6.20 17.22\nNovember 6 6.29 17.14\n16 6.37 17.07\n26 6.47 17.03\nDecember 6 6.55 17.03\n16 7.02 17.05\n26 7.06 17.10",
