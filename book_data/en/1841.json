    "body": "In Ribeiro do Meio, on a slope of the S. Jorge valley, many years ago, different layers of tuffs and clays were found in the same place where the lignite appears, in one of which there were numerous Dicotyledon and Fern leaves. Dr. Heer, who studied these leaves, recognized that they belonged to 25 species, including the yew, the laurel, the heather, the bearberry, the myrtle, and the myrtle. In a light tuft to the west of the village of Porto da Cruz, some leaves and leaf impressions also appear, perhaps belonging to Rubus Bollei and Carex pendula, as well as pieces of a spongy and soft wood. When we talk about lignite, we will refer again to the deposit of S. Jorge; as for the deposit of Porto da Cruz, it can be assumed that it formed in an ancient lake, perhaps limited by the islet of the bay, where the tuffs and sands that erosion later brought to light accumulated.",
