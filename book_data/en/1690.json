    "body": "He was born in the parish of Ponta do Sol in the first quarter of the 16th century, the son of D. João Henriques and D. Filipa de Noronha. He was a close relative of Father Luiz Gonçalves da Câmara (see this name), the famous guardian of D. Sebastião, and descended from João Gonçalves Zargo, the illustrious discoverer of Madeira. He studied canons in Paris and Coimbra, and was the first rector of the University of Évora. He embraced the institute of the Society of Jesus in the time of its founder, maintaining close relations of friendship with him and receiving direct proofs of the highest consideration and esteem. He held the highest positions in his order, such as rector of the colleges of Coimbra and Évora, provincial, delegate in Rome, etc. For many years, he was the confessor and advisor to the cardinal and king D. Henrique, with whom he enjoyed great prestige and influence. He had a great reputation in his time as a man of vast erudition and extraordinary talent. His biographers particularly refer to the feelings of the most generous and ardent charity with which he was endowed, showing the most refined expressions of affection and tenderness towards the poor and unfortunate that the human heart is capable of. He died in Lisbon on April 8, 1589.",
