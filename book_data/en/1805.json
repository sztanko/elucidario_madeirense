    "body": "These nuns came to Madeira in 1900 and soon founded a home for the elderly, to which the diocesan prelate D. Manuel Agostinho Barreto and Father Antonio José de Macedo contributed greatly, as already mentioned in the article Asilos, on page 94 of the 1st volume of this work. With the decree of expulsion of religious orders from our country, the Irmãzinhas dos Pobres had to abandon the home they had founded, leaving Madeira, in a group of twelve, on April 18, 1911, heading towards the French city of Latour.",
