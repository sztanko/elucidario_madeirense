According to the statutes, the society had 40 ordinary members and could also have up to 5 honorary members. Ordinary members paid a fee of 10,000 réis and a monthly fee of 200 réis; honorary members paid the same monthly fee but were exempt from paying the fee. The Esperança Society was established in 1858 with only 18 members initially, and its statutes were approved on February 15, 1860, signed by the interim directors Francisco Leandro Severim, João Maria da Silva Carvalho, Luís Alvares da Silva, Pedro Augusto da Silva Carvalho, and João Alexandre de Carvalho. The decree approving the statutes is dated May 10 of the same year. According to the Direito, on December 4, 1858, the statutes were drafted by the member Nuno Dias de Vasconcelos, and among the founding members of the society were also Julio Galhardo de Freitas, who had already performed at the Concórdia theater, and Pedro de Alcantara Góis, who had made his debut in a performance at the Lancasterian School.
