    "body": "Bodies of basaltic nature, sometimes rounded, other times oblong and tapered at the ends, and almost always with parallel longitudinal grooves. They are projectiles once thrown into space by a volcanic activity that disappeared many centuries ago. They are commonly found either loose or embedded in the slopes of the most recent volcanic cones in the lower part of Madeira, and on the other islands of the archipelago. Embedded in the tuffs of these slopes and alongside these volcanic bombs, there are other bodies of basalt, elongated and contorted like ropes, which, having the same volcanic origin, had a mode of formation perhaps distinct from that of the actual bombs. Characteristic specimens of both can be found in many locations, including Porto do Moniz, S. Martinho, Garajau, Caniçal, Porto Santo, and Selvagem Grande.",
