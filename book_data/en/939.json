Some of these species are edible, such as the Ammanita vaginata, the Lactarius deliciosus, the Cantharellus cibarius, the Psaliotta campestris (field mushroom), the Boletus edulis, and the B. bovinus, etc. The Madeirans do not usually use mushrooms as food, and in the fields, people often destroy them, considering them the work of witches.\n\n## See also: Torrend.",
