    "body": "This chapel, located in the area of Trapiche in the parish of Santo António, is only known by the name of the place where it was built. The Sergeant-Major João António de Gouveia Rego, owner of the Trapiche estate, had a chapel dedicated to São João and Santana built there in 1814. The first mass was celebrated and the chapel was blessed on August 14 of the same year. It has an excellent country house attached, which for some time served as a seminary after this educational establishment ceased to function in the Incarnação building (1921).\n\nThis house, chapel, and its surroundings have undergone significant modifications, as you can see in the article\n\n> Asylums\n",
