    "body": "A fish of the Miliobatida family that sometimes appears near the coast of Madeira. It is the largest of the rays, measuring in some cases about 2 meters, and fishermen harpoon it whenever they can, as it is considered harmful to humans, although the crimes it is accused of have not been confirmed. It is a common belief among fishermen that when a urjamanta catches a man, it holds him under its body, only releasing him after he is dead.",
