    "body": "This name represents a tribute paid by the Funchal City Council to Brigadier Oudinot, who, through his services to Madeira, became well worthy of the gratitude of the inhabitants of this island. Rua do Oudinot connects the Praça dos Lavradores with the Larguinho de S. João, and there used to be a bridge over the João Gomes stream a little below it, which we suppose collapsed or was demolished in the late second quarter of the 19th century. It provides access to the Largo dos Lavradores, where the new Market was built.",
