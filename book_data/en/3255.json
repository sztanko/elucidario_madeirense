    "body": "Upon entering the small but beautiful bay of Machico, to the left, perched on the ocean, is a chapel dedicated to São Roque, at the foot of which is the well-known fountain of the same name. The existing chapel is not the original one, which was located a short distance from the current one, approximately in the square there, overlooking the sea. It was of ancient construction, but we do not know the year of its foundation. Being in an advanced state of ruin, it was ordered to be rebuilt by the respective brotherhood in 1739, and was then erected at the location where it currently stands. The license granted for its blessing is from June 6 of that year, but on the main altar, the date 1751 is read, which may refer to the placement of the same altar in place of another that may have existed there. The chapel is adorned inside with exquisite tiles, representing the main episodes of the saint's life, which have been the object of admiration by nationals and foreigners, and indeed deserve to be visited. From the center of the town to the churchyard of the chapel, there is a beautiful road, which in the summer season is very popular with vacationers who spend the calm season in Machico.\n\nSee also: São Roque (Águas de).",
