    "body": "This is the title of a 10-page booklet published in this city by Miguel Manuel de Ornelas e Vasconcelos in 1897. From the 'argument' that follows, one can judge the merit of the work. 'In September, Bacchus and divine Ceres, joining the world, give a harvest. I will tell you what I saw on the Faial mountain, which inflamed my inspiration, heart, and vein. So poor, so miserable in wealth, it could be strong and full of knowledge, it comes chaotic, hoarse, and untempered. Touching the rough and out-of-tune lyre.' Miguel de Ornelas, who held the position of solicitor in the Funchal district, passed away in this city on October 3, 1889.",
