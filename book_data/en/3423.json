    "body": "A cactus native to tropical America, naturalized and cultivated in the lower region of Madeira. The berry-like fruits of the Tabaibeira are sweet and fresh, and the fleshy-succulent and compressed-jointed branches (commonly leaves) of the plant are a good food for cattle, after being cleaned of their respective thorns. The Tabaibeira peels are used as feed for pigs. In Campo de Baixo and Serra de Dentro on the island of Porto Santo, some Tabaibeira plants appear.",
