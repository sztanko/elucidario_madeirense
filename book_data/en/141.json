    "body": "Garlic belongs to the Liliaceae family, and the most well-known types in Madeira are: common garlic (Allium sativum), leek (A. Ampeloprasum), and wild or American garlic (Nothoscordum inodorum). The common garlic bulb is made up of cloves enclosed in a common tunic. This species is widely cultivated in Madeira and Porto Santo for culinary purposes and has diuretic, vermifuge, and antiseptic properties. The wild garlic, originating from subtropical America, is a plant that propagates extremely easily both through its bulbs and seeds.",
