    "body": "Commander of the military expedition that came to Madeira in 1828, with the purpose of subduing this island to the Miguelist government. He became known for the serious disagreements he had with the Governor and Captain-General José Maria Monteiro, even requesting the replacement of this authority by the Government due to his incapacity and for habitually listening only to 'an infamous circle of individuals abominable for their vices and bad habits.' On one occasion, he insulted the Governor at the Palace of S. Lourenço, not hitting him because several officers present opposed it.\n\nColonel Lemos allowed the troops under his command to commit all kinds of excesses against the constitutionalists, becoming therefore unsympathetic to the majority of the population of Funchal.",
