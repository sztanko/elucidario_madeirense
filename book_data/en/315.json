    "body": "The highest eminence on Selvagem Grande, one hundred and fifty meters above the sea and cut sheer on the western coast of the island. It constitutes a volcanic cone sectioned to the west; and, according to recent observations, its geological composition includes various rocks, among which decomposed phonolites where compact basalts are placed at the base, and perfect phonolites, serving as a support for horizontal strata of volcanic tuffs. On this set, masses of more or less scoriaceous limburgite, with a reddish tone, were deposited, which form the upper finish of the Peak. The appearance of this cone, largely already in ruins, seems to lead to the conclusion that it was, in very remote eras, one of the craters through which the materials that now form Selvagem Grande were ejaculated.",
