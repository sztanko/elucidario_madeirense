The 'passos' that existed in Funchal in our days were located in the following places: the north side of Jardim Pequeno (now Avenida do Dr. Manuel de Arriaga), Rua do Aljube (now Captain-Tenente Carvalho de Araújo), Largo do Pelourinho, and Rua de Santa Maria.\n\nThe Procession of the Passos made a stop at each of the mentioned stations of Christ's passion (1921).\n\nWe read somewhere that Governor D. José Manuel da Camara had a statue of Jesus Christ made in the alley of Jacinto Acciaioly.",
