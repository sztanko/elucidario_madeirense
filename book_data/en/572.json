    "body": "In the work of the distinguished genealogist Viscount de Sanches de Baena, published in 1872 and entitled Archivo Heraldico Genealogico, there is a summarized report of several thousand grants, by which many individuals were granted the use of a coat of arms, with the date of the grant, some genealogical data of the awardee, and a brief description of the coat of arms itself. This work includes the report of many grants to individuals native to or residing on this island, granting them the privilege of a coat of arms. We will only list their names and the dates of the grants, omitting the remaining information, so as not to make this article too extensive. Those interested can consult the extracts of the grants found in the cited work. The individuals mentioned there are as follows: [list of names and dates of grants]",
