He was studying law at the University of Coimbra when premature death took him by surprise on October 21, 1918. He collaborated in some newspapers of this city, notably in Diario da Madeira. His early verses were indicative of a promising and determined vocation for poetry. He published a volume of verses entitled Nevoas de Lagrimas in Coimbra.",
