    "body": "The annotator of 'Saudades da Terra' says the following about him: 'Sim達o Nunes Cardoso, who certainly was from the Cardosos de Gaula family, Captaincy of Machico, since there were no others of that surname: he lived in 1566, as he wrote the Account of the sack that the French made on the island of Madeira, which happened that year. This account was never printed, but probably Jeronymo Dias Leite copied the narrative of the case for his History of Madeira, and from there it passed to chapters XLIV-XLVI of 'Saudades da Terra', which persuades us that there is no record of another account of this case, and that those found in 'Saudades' are manifestly inspired by the rivalry between the Captaincy of Machico and that of Funchal, and to the discredit of the latter'.",
