    "body": "Our main forests are of laurels, chestnut trees, and pine trees. Laurels dominate in the valleys of the interior of Madeira; chestnut trees form important groves below 750 or 800 meters; and pine trees, which now rise to an altitude of 1200 meters, cover extensive tracts of land on the southern and northern slopes, constituting one of the most important riches of the island.\n\nThe tis, vinhaticos, barbuzanos, white woods, adernos, folhados, hollies, and other indigenous essences are tending to disappear from Madeira's woodland, and the ancient heather forests that we knew 30 or 40 years ago in the upper region of the island have long been destroyed by loggers and charcoal burners, without anyone thinking of holding them accountable for their acts of vandalism.\n\nMadeira, which at the time of its discovery was an extensive forest that had to be set on fire to clear the land, now has its wooded area greatly reduced by wild essences. We believe that this area does not exceed 15,000 hectares, which is very little in a rugged land like ours. It is therefore advisable to create new groves, especially on the banks of rivers and on the slopes of the central mountains, so that their roots sustain the land and the torrents do not rush down with violence, causing incalculable damage.
