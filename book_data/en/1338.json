    "body": "The lighting of the other end of the southern coast of Madeira, with the S. Lourenço lighthouse to the east and the projected Ponta do Pargo lighthouse to the west, is also a recognized necessity. The building and other facilities intended for the installation of the lighthouse and its staff were constructed some years ago, and all the work has been completed. Only the acquisition of the respective lantern and other equipment for the lighthouse installation is awaited, which the European conflict prevented from being operational. The continuation of the building is due to the General Assembly of this district, which will soon acquire the lighthouse and proceed with its installation. (1921).\n\nThe Ponta do Pargo lighthouse was inaugurated on June 5, 1922. It is located at the tip of Vigia, about 375 meters above sea level, at the site where there was once a telegraph and was known by the name of Casa do Rei. It is mentioned elsewhere that this lighthouse \"emits three successive flashes of white light with a power of 5,500 candles, each lasting 0.5 seconds, at intervals of 3.5 seconds\".",
