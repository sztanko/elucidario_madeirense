    "body": "Around 250 species of fish have been caught in the seas of Madeira, many of them remarkable for the brightness of their colors or the singularity of their shape or structure. In the publications of Lowe and Johnson (see these names), the mentioned species are listed, and in the present work, we also mention some of them, such as the alfonsim, needlefish, sea bream, tunas, barracuda, parrotfish, bogue, boqueirão, mackerel, castanhetas, conger eels, horse mackerel, wreckfish, gilt-head bream, swordfish, forkbeards, grouper, blacktail comber, moray eels, porgies, triggerfish, needlefish, John dory, green wrasse, requeime, salema, red mullet, white seabream, grey mullet, etc. The only freshwater fish living in Madeira are the eiró (see this name) and the Cyprinus auratus, but the latter is not found outside the tanks of the cultivated region of the island. Subordinate to the title 'The Fish of the Seas of Madeira', the distinguished men of science Adolfo Cesar de Noronha and Lieutenant Colonel Alberto Artur Sarmento published a comprehensive study in 1934, which will be profitably consulted by all who wish to know this interesting subject, from any point of view in which it may be considered.",
