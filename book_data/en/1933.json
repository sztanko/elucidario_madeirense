    "body": "An officer of the 6th hunters who was assassinated in the Colégio barracks by the soldiers of this battalion on July 31, 1852. It is said that he was the commander the mutineers intended to kill, but as the lieutenant confronted them, it gave time for a corporal named Miguel Fernandes to close the door through which the soldiers had to pass to reach the commander's room, and for the latter, forewarned of what was happening, to flee.\nMiguel Fernandes, the aforementioned corporal, was for many years the overseer of the S. Pedro square, having been decorated by the government for having saved his commander from the wrath of the undisciplined soldiery.\nThe newspapers of the time did not dare to comment on the excesses of the 6th hunters battalion, but years later a Madeiran newspaper said that these excesses had been promoted by individuals of the civilian class in order to expel the commander from the island, who belonged to the regenerating party.",
