    "body": "_V. Escola Industrial\n\nBefore the creation of the Funchal lyceum, the following classes operated in this city: mathematics, philosophy, rhetoric, French and English, Latin grammar, and Latinity. The mathematics teacher had an annual salary of 500,000 reis in 1821; the philosophy teacher had 460,000 reis; the rhetoric teacher had 440,000 reis; the Latin grammar teacher had 400,000 reis; and the Latinity teacher had 400,000 reis. The substitute for the first of these chairs had an annual salary of 250,000 reis; the second, 230,000 reis; and the third and fifth, 200,000 reis each. The Latin grammar teacher seems to have had no substitute. All these classes, except for French and English, were established by virtue of the law of November 6, 1772, which also created a Greek class that never came to function. The French and English class was created during the time of Governor D. Manuel de Portugal e Castro. There was also a special drawing chair, created in 1810, whose teacher received an annual salary of 600,000 reis.",
