    "body": "Fish from the labrid family, common along the coasts of all the islands of this archipelago, including the Selvagens, and rightly appreciated for its delicate flavor. It is a beautiful species, with a color that can vary greatly, ranging from dark slate speckled with light tones to bright red, while some individuals are simultaneously red and gray. This explains the distinction made in some fishing communities between brown, red, and thistle bodião. It is not a migratory fish, but its somewhat nomadic habits lead it to move in the shallow waters near the coast. Although not as common as it once was, it is still one of the rare coastal species that has managed to escape the destructive effects of the senseless and ruinous fishing by explosives, albeit to a lesser extent. \n\nThe capture takes place from the seashore to 30 fathoms deep, using, in addition to hook devices, trawl and gill nets, as well as traps and pots; however, the preferred device is the rod, both for fishing enthusiasts and professional fishermen. As bait, jackfruit or spider, crustaceans found under the rocks along the coast between the two tidal limits, are usually used. \n\nOn the coast of the Desertas, the fishermen of Caniçal sometimes make abundant catches of this fish, which, after being scaled and salted, is brought to the market in Funchal, although somewhat devalued by salting.",
