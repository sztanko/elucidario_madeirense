Dr. Azevedo also mentions a Spaniard named Diogo Martins, to whom Queen D. Catarina granted arms in 1560. During the time when the French plundered Funchal, Cristovão Martins and the finance clerk João Martins resided here, and among the individuals who signed the vote document in which S. Tiago Menor was taken as the patron saint of the city, Fernão Martins appears, but it is unknown if he belonged to the nobility of the island.",
