    "body": "On April 20, 1600, Cristovão Falcão e Sousa was appointed as the general governor of the Madeira archipelago. Some mistakenly believed him to be the famous author of Crisfal, while others claim he was his son, a controversial point.\n\nFalgairolle (Edmond) published a pamphlet of 31 pages in 1895 in Paris, entitled Une expedition française à l'ile de Madère en 1566, which deals with the terrible assault that the French corsairs made on the island in October 1566. Gaspar Frutuoso extensively covers this event in chapters XL, XLI, and XLII of Saudades da Terra.\n\n## See Saque dos Franceses.",
