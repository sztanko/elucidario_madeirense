    "body": "Small bird of the Procellariidae family, which spends part of its life on the high seas, sometimes straying quite far from the coast. On dark nights, it flies over the coastal rocks, emitting a cry that somewhat resembles the name by which it is known. Its posture consists of a single egg, which it lays in a crevice in the rocks, and it is white, except at one end, where it has reddish spots. It feeds on marine animals, which it shares with its offspring, and when attacked in the nest, it vomits an oil of a beautiful wine color and characteristic smell.",
