As a standard for the centenary celebrations commemorating the Independence and Restoration of Portugal, the 'Juventude Antoniana' society of the mentioned parish had an interesting cross erected at this location, which was solemnly inaugurated in 1941 and became another reason to visit this site, connected to the city center by an excellent and popular road.",
