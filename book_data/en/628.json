    "body": "This is the public road that directly connects Rua Direita with the small square of the Carmo church, and it is accessed by the Medinas and Monteiro streets. Its name originated from the former city jail located at the intersection formed by this street and Rua Direita, to the right of those heading from the Carmo church towards the latter street. The house that belonged to the Oliveira family is located on Rua da Cadeia Velha, whose members included João Francisco de Oliveira, Joaquim de Oliveira Alvares, and Benjamim de Oliveira (see these names), among others. Paulo Perestrelo da Câmara asserts that it was one of the largest urban properties in Funchal, and its construction is believed to date back to the early 18th century.",
