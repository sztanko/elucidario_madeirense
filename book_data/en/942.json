    "body": "The memory of the horrific calamity that devastated this archipelago from July to October 1856, claiming the lives of about ten thousand of its inhabitants, is still vivid in the local tradition.\n\nCholera-morbus was rampant in Lisbon, and the epidemic had manifested itself with extraordinary virulence in the Belém neighborhood. The 1st Infantry Regiment was stationed in that neighborhood, and due to a criminally negligent decision by the central government, it was sent to Madeira, where it arrived on the afternoon of June 28, immediately disembarking and taking over the former convent of São Francisco. On July 2, the regiment moved to the College of São João Evangelista, and it was there that the first cases of cholera appeared among some of the soldiers. The first Madeiran to be affected was a sailor named Manuel Rodrigues, who lived near the convent of São Francisco and had been in contact with some soldiers from the 1st Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe epidemic began to spread intensely, especially in the Santa Maria neighborhood, then extending to the entire city and rapidly reaching the suburban and rural parishes. It was like a fire raging everywhere. It reached its peak on July 31, claiming the lives of 162 of our compatriots within the city area in a 24-hour period.\n\nOutside Funchal, the epidemic first appeared in the parish of Ponta Pargo on July 11, and in Machico on the 14th, and subsequently in the remaining parishes, with some of them experiencing a very low mortality rate.\n\nThe largest influx of patients was at the Mercy Hospital, where, on some days, it was impossible to admit more cholera patients due to the large number already filling the wards and all available spaces for a bed. The military hospital and the Mendicidade Asylum building were adapted to accommodate cholera patients, and temporary hospitals were set up in the parishes of São Antonio, Ribeira Brava, Machico, Ponta do Sol, and others.\n\nAccording to an official report, while the epidemic was terrifying in the municipality of Funchal due to the devastation it caused, its horrors were even greater in the rural municipalities. In addition to the high number of victims, the population also struggled with hunger and lacked doctors and medicines to attend to the sick. The state of discouragement, distress, and misery that these municipalities reached was truly indescribable. Many patients died due to the absolute lack of medical assistance, while others perished from lack of food. Most of the temporary hospitals were in terrible conditions, lacking even the most basic supplies. The patients lay on the floor, on poor bedding, with frequent instances of the mixing of the living and the dead. In light of this, the authorities decided that the technical delegates Branco and Brand should travel across the island, bringing medicines and other supplies to help the cholera patients. It was not possible to do more than what was done. According to official data, cholera claimed the lives of 7,041 individuals, but it has always been stated that the number of those who succumbed to the epidemic was approximately ten thousand. In the municipality of Funchal, 2,014 people died, with 311 in the parish of Sé, 519 in São Pedro, 376 in Santa Maria Maior, 69 in São Roque, 129 in São Martinho, 315 in Santa Luzia, 214 in São Antonio, 83 in Monte, and 88 in São Gonçalo.\n\nThe rural parishes with the highest mortality rates were Ponta do Pargo with 328 deaths, Machico 319, Camara de Lôbos 393, Campanario 206, Ponta do Sol 281, Tabua 161, Serra d’Agua 143, Ponta Delgada 409, São Vicente 307, Estreito de Camara de Lôbos 139, etc. At the Mercy Hospital, 619 individuals died, 119 at the São Antonio hospital, and 63 at the Asylum hospital.\n\nIn the article dedicated to the Civil Governor Antonio Rogerio Gromicho Couceiro, we will highlight the truly providential action that this authority exercised among us and the great gratitude that Madeira owes him for the remarkable services he provided to the entire archipelago. We also want to mention Dr. Antonio da Luz Pita, who was the delegate of the health council of the kingdom and, while in Lisbon as a deputy for this island, immediately departed for Funchal on the warship Mindelo, carrying the aid that the central government had promptly sent, along with some doctors who came from the mainland to provide clinical services on the island. These initial aids consisted of a large supply of medicines, clothing, beds, bedding, etc., and a credit of six thousand réis, which was followed by new and abundant shipments of aid. The medical community distinguished itself with its extraordinary dedication, with three Madeiran doctors and one Englishman, Dr. Ross, falling victim to the disease.\n\nWe would go too far if we were to delve into further details and more detailed notes regarding the terrible epidemic that devastated this archipelago in 1856.\n\nFor those who wish to have a more in-depth understanding of the subject, they can consult the second part of the official report published in 1866 and the articles published in the Heraldo da Madeira in October 1908.\n\nCholera in 1910. The cholera epidemic that manifested in Funchal in October 1910 did not come close to the proportions of the cholera-morbus of 1856. Although its duration was roughly the same, the number of those affected and those who succumbed to it was very uneven. According to official data, the 1856 epidemic claimed 7,041 lives, while the 1910-1911 epidemic claimed only 556. Perhaps the nature of the disease was less virulent, but the disproportionate mortality can mainly be attributed to the means employed to combat the epidemic. The times are very different, the resources available to science in the two periods are entirely different, and there is no comparison between them. There is currently a more accurate understanding of the duties to be fulfilled by both the official elements and the rural populations. Hygiene is no longer an empty word, especially in populous centers, and it is observed with some rigor, especially during epidemic diseases. All of this contributed powerfully to the disproportionate contagion, spread, and damage caused by the cholera of 1856 and 1910. We were fortunate to have at the forefront of the various services combating the epidemic a highly distinguished doctor, who, as a man of science and a highly regarded bacteriologist, an essentially organized spirit, of rare and prudent energy, of limitless selflessness and zeal, and also of the most proven authority of character, provided this land, in such a calamitous time and in such difficult and heartbreaking circumstances, with services that can never be forgotten. His prestigious name will forever be linked to the history of our archipelago, alongside those who have most deserved the recognition and gratitude of its inhabitants.\n\nThe first cases that caught the attention of the doctors were those of two sisters living near Paiol, with one being affected on October 20, 1910, and the other on the 23rd of the same month, with the latter passing away on November 4. The necessary precautions were immediately taken, including isolating the home, disinfection, medical examination of contracts, etc. Subsequently, two more cases appeared on Imperatriz D. Amelia Street, followed by others in various parts of the city. The disease soon emerged in Camara de Lôbos, Machico, and other locations. The population began to be alarmed, and the district's superior authority, deeply impressed by the spread of the disease, convened the Advisory Board of Hygiene on November 17, taking more energetic and fruitful measures, while also urging the central government to adopt extraordinary measures and send the necessary resources, which Madeira did not have. \n\nWith extraordinary powers, the central government sent Dr. José Alfredo Mendes de Magalhãis to Madeira as the high commissioner of the republic, who provided excellent services and consistently showed the best intentions to effectively cooperate in extinguishing the epidemic during his time here. As a well-deserved tribute to these services, a solemn session was held at the Municipal Chamber of this municipality in his honor, where he was awarded the distinction of honorary citizen of Funchal and his portrait was unveiled in the council's main hall. In addition to extraordinary credits to meet the large expenses of combating the epidemic, the government also sent a contingent of troops, due to the well-founded fear of public order disturbances. \n\nHowever, the most judicious measure taken by the mainland government was the arrival of Dr. Carlos França, who arrived in Funchal on November 22 and, after a few days of laboratory work and other necessary studies, took over the direction of the health services and the fight against the scourge that threatened to devastate the entire island, demonstrating not only the most reliable guidance and proven competence, but also a fervent zeal and the most fervent dedication in carrying out the multiple functions that he had to perform in the midst of such a laborious and risky mission. Seven doctors, several nurses, and an analyst from the Camara Pestana Bacteriological Institute came from the mainland, who, together with the doctors from Madeira, provided good services and showed true selflessness in performing the tasks assigned to them. \n\nCholera hospitals operated at the Lazareto de Gonçalo Aires and in the parishes of Santo Antonio, Camara de Lôbos, Ribeira Brava, Santa Cruz, and Machico. \n\nThe epidemic raged in the municipalities of Funchal, Santa Cruz, Machico, Camara de Lôbos, Ponta do Sol, and Pôrto Santo, sparing the parishes of Madalena, Serra de Agua, Curral das Freiras, Santo da Serra, and the entire municipality of Calheta, with the exception of Fajã da Ovelha, where only two cases occurred. The thirteen parishes of the entire north coast of Madeira were also spared. The number of deaths, by municipality, was 210 in Funchal, 161 in Camara de Lôbos, 71 in Ponta do Sol, 75 in Machico, 26 in Santa Cruz, and Pôrto Santo, with a total of 556. \n\nWe would go far if we were to delve into details about the way the various health services were set up and performed, and even further if we wanted to specify many episodes and circumstances worthy of special mention, but which do not fit within the limits of this article. Anyone wishing to do so will only need to consult the brilliant and detailed work written by Dr. Carlos França, entitled The Cholera Epidemic in Madeira 1910-1911. Report presented to the Minister of the Interior, where they will find everything that may be of interest during this calamitous period of Madeira's history.",
