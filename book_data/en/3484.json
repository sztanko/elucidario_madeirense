    "body": "A fish of the Carcharuda family that appears in our seas, where it is the genuine representative of sharks. It has a bluish back, which is why it is known in some countries by the name of blue shark. Fishermen always seek to kill it as soon as they spot it, as it is one of the most fearsome animals in our seas. Its meat, of inferior quality, is rarely used.",
