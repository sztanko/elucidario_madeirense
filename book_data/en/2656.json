    "body": "Bird of the common Fringillidae family in Madeira and Porto Santo, which feeds on seeds and insects. While it causes damage to the crops due to the large quantity of grains it consumes, it should also be considered as an ally to the farmers, as it destroys a great number of harmful insects, especially when feeding its chicks in the nests. In the past, there were municipal regulations aimed at destroying this species. It is quite curious that the Porto Santo City Council required each head of the household to present 25 sparrow heads throughout the month of June each year. It nests from February to June, usually in wall cavities or under the roof tiles of houses. Its nests are poorly finished and contain wool, cattle hair, human hair, and especially chicken feathers. The eggs, in a number of 5 or 6 per laying, vary greatly in color and pattern, ranging from whitish to tawny or yellowish.",
