    "body": "A comprehensive study of Madeiran folklore, encompassing the beliefs, traditions, and popular customs of this archipelago, is yet to be undertaken. This study should not only focus on the simple perspective of the naive songs used by the people, but also on a more general aspect, encompassing the old regional customs in their various and characteristic modalities. Nevertheless, various scattered writings by Adolfo de Noronha, A. Artur Sarmento, Carlos Santos, E. Antonino Pestana, J. Reis Gomes, and Viscount of Porto da Cruz provide valuable elements for this study. In the articles Bucho Encostado, Costumes Antigos, Crenças Populares, Indumentaria, Lendas, Medicina Campestre, Mau Olhado, Natal, Procissões, and Romaria of this Elucidario, there are also several pieces of information that can be useful for the same study.",
