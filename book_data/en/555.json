This chronicler says that Marcos de Braga \"was so hairy that even his nails on the outside, and on his face up to near his eyes were covered with hair...\". His son of the same name inherited his father's bravery and also performed some acts of great valor and courage, which Frutuoso did not forget to mention.",
