    "body": "Born in this city on March 26, 1828, and died here on April 6, 1878. He resided abroad for several years, especially in England, where he perfected his knowledge of the French and English languages. In 1863, he was appointed a professor at the Funchal lyceum, where he taught these subjects until his death. He contributed prose and poetry to some newspapers in this city. Under the title 'Flores Agrestes', a volume of poems was published in Funchal in 1860, which is the first part of the work containing the poetic compositions of João Fortunato de Oliveira. The second part, which was supposed to contain the poems of Januário Justiniano de Nóbrega (see this name), did not see the light of publicity.",
