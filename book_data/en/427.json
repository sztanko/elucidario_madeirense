    "body": "What the people in this island rightfully call a 'barreira,' is known as 'bardo,' which means the fence or barrier made of stakes and tree branches, intended to prevent the livestock that grazed freely in the mountains and commons from descending to the inhabited areas and cultivated lands. These 'bardos' were and still are common among us and generally constituted the dividing line between cultivated land and common areas for grazing livestock and gathering firewood and brush. The old municipal regulations of some chambers of this archipelago contained several provisions regarding 'bardos,' livestock grazing, etc. The current legislation has profoundly altered those municipal laws and established other provisions, especially those concerning the freedom of sheep, goats, and pigs to graze in the so-called common areas.",
