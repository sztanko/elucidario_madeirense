    "body": "The disease that causes the most damage to seedling plantations is due to Phytophthora infestans, a fungus of the Peronosporaceae family. Plants invaded by this fungus present dark spots on the leaves and generally end up drying out. Scab is another disease that affects seedlings and has been identified with the wet gangrene of some European localities due to its effects.",
