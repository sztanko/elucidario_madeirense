The true swallows, Hirundo rustica Chelidonaria urbica, which regularly visit these islands without breeding, are known in Porto Santo by the name of 'outside swallows' and in some parishes in the north of Madeira by the designation of 'Porto Santo swallows', perhaps because when they arrive at the northern coast of Madeira, they come from the northeast, that is, from the side of Porto Santo.",
