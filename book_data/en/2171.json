    "body": "Aromatic herb, cultivated in some Madeiran gardens, solely to be used as a condiment in the kitchens. It is native to North America and Middle Asia, and is also known by the name of oregano (see this name). The Majarona paniculata, probably a simple variety of M. Maiorca, also appears in some gardens, easily distinguished from M. hortensis by not having the lower lip of the calyx very small or absent.",
