In March 1888, he visited Deserta Grande, which he discusses in his book *La Carrière d'un navigateur*, with the chapter referring to that island being translated by Mr. Alberto Sarmento and published in *Heraldo da Madeira*. In the *Bulletin of the Zoological Society of France* (1892), a work titled *Orthoptères provenant des voyages de S. A. le prince de Monaco dans les archipels de Madère et des Açores* was published, and in the *Bulletin of the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco* (1914), there is a work by L. Gain, entitled *Algues provenant des Campagnes de l'Hirondelle* II(1911-1912).",
