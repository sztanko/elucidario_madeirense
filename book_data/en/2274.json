    "body": "This was the name of an annual festival of a private nature, as it was not authorized by any liturgical indication, which was sometimes celebrated with pomp inside convents of nuns and without the direct interference of their respective chaplains, however, it took on an edifying form of devotion and piety worthy of special appreciation. In the Santa Clara convent of this city, it was established around the mid-17th century by the pious nun Clara da Chaga. The details about this festival and its specifics can be found in \"O Jornal\" of January 6, 1934. The book \"Ripas da Madeira\" contains interesting details about the \"Menino de Jesus Perdido\" festivals, although outlined with some elements of pure fiction.",
