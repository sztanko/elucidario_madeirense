It is now called Alferes Veiga Pestana street, and before having this name, it was called Hortas street (see this name). The small stream that gave it its name is the Vale stream, which comes from Pena and passes through João de Deus avenue and Carmo street. In this last street, near Rego alley, there used to be a bridge that formed a large bulge in the terrain and was lowered in 1906.",
