    "body": "Born in the parish of Madalena do Mar on January 26, 1836, and died in the town of Ponta do Sol on May 26, 1875. He was a surgeon by the Funchal School and secretary of the administration of the municipality of Ponta do Sol. According to the testimony of his contemporaries, Policarpo dos Passos Sousa possessed a prodigious talent, which misfortune did not allow to manifest itself with the vigor and brilliance that was much desired. He collaborated in some newspapers and was considered in his time as an inspired poet, and his verse compositions were very popular. One of his compositions can be found in the 1st volume of Flores da Madeira.",
