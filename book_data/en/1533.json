The laying takes place on the sea cliffs during April and May, with the nest consisting of three eggs of varying colors, built with dry, interwoven plants.\n\nThe Madeirans call the young individuals of the seagull 'gaio' or 'gaivoto,' which are distinguished from the adults by their dark plumage, which is only replaced by the definitive plumage after three years.",
