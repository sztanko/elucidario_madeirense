    "body": "Of the three Ericaceae known by this name in Madeira, only two are important for their products: Erica Scoparia, known as 'urze durasia' or 'das vassouras', and E. arb√≥rea, known as 'urze molar' or 'betouro'. The trunks, clumps, and roots of these two species provide the best charcoal on the island, and their branches and twigs, after drying, are used as fuel. The 'urze molar', although almost always shrubby, can reach a height of 8 to 10 meters and was once known to have individuals whose trunks measured 1 to 2 meters in circumference. The wood of this species is hard, compact, and dark brown, but it splits easily, so it is not widely used in carpentry. In the fields, it is sometimes used for walking sticks, etc. The not very thick stems provide excellent walking sticks and fishing rods. The 'urze durasia' is almost always shrubby, and only in some cases does it reach 4 to 5 meters in height, presenting a small trunk with a diameter of 20 to 30 centimeters. Its branches, in addition to the uses indicated, are used for making brooms.",
