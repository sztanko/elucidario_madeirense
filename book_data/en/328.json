However, the Judges and the Auditor remained, and this magistrate now has not only the attributions conferred by the 1895 code and the 1896 code, but also the contentious and consultative attributions that belonged to the said Commission, now extinct, according to the two aforementioned codes.\n\nThe laws of August 7, 1913, and June 23, 1916, did not alter the competence and attributions of the administrative courts to which we refer.\n\nThe general secretary performs the functions of the public ministry alongside the administrative auditor.\n\n## District Commission and Administrative Court.",
