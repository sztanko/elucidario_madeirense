    "body": "This public road, which directly connects Aranhas Street (now Dr. Chaves Street) with Ribeiro Real Square, was opened a few years ago, on the occasion of the demolition and repairs that the old alleys called the cemetery underwent, which were in the vicinity of the two British cemeteries. The date of June 5, 1834, marks the proclamation of the constitutional government in Madeira, and this new street was named to commemorate that auspicious event.",
