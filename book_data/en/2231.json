    "body": "The old building in Funchal, located on Rua dos Aranhas, is known as 'Casa de Dona Mécia', which we have already mentioned in this work (1-183). For some years, it housed the School of Teacher Training and was previously the location of the Protestant temple of the ritualist sect. Some individuals considered this house as the setting for the tragic adventures that the distinguished Madeiran writer João Augusto de Ornelas fantastically constructed in his curious novel 'A mão de Sangue', and also gave credence to the interesting narrative of Camilo Castelo Branco, included in his book 'O Santo da Montanha' (chapters XXV-XXXI), which contains some valuable details about Madeira.\n\nIn September 1940, the 'Casa de Dona Mécia' was included in the list of national monuments and properties of public interest, through a decree published in the 'Diário do Govêrno', due to its old and typical construction, certain characteristics, and peculiarities. Therefore, it came under the direct action of the public department that oversees these services. The Casa de Dona Mécia was classified as a 'property of public interest'.",
