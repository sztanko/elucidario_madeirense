Francisco, in Calheta, Nossa Senhora da Piedade, in Santa Cruz, and Nossa Senhora da Porciuncula, in Ribeira Brava. Also of the same order, there were three convents of nuns, all in Funchal: Santa Clara, Nossa Senhora das Mercês, and Nossa Senhora da Incarnação. Of these monastic houses, only the church and part of the convent of Santa Clara and the church of Incarnação still exist.\n\nThe Jesuits also had a religious house or college in Funchal, now serving as a barracks, which still exists with its adjoining church.
