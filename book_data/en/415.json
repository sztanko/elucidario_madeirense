In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, he was renowned as one of the most notable preachers of his time. In 1699, he published a pamphlet entitled 'Panegyric Sermon on the most solemn and anniversary feast, which the reverend chapter of the Funchal Cathedral of the island of Madeira held in the afternoon of the eighth day of Corpus Christi to the glorious St. Anthony, on June 13, 1697.' In the parish of S. Pedro and Caminho de Santo Antonio, there was the chapel of S. Francisco, better known as S. Francisco das Furnas. It was founded by Canon Pedro Correia Barbosa in 1697. It belonged to the trustee Jervis de Atouguia. In the house adjacent to it, the Viscount of Atouguia was born on July 7, 1797.",
