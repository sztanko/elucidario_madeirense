Henrique, by whose order he participated in the explorations promoted by the same Infante: he was one of the first settlers of the island, and had the lands from Ponta do Garajau upwards to the Caniço river, from the sea to the mountains, as a sesmaria in Caniço, where later his son Álvaro de Ornellas Saavedra established the entailed estate called Caniço. – Constança de Mendonça de Vasconcellos, the first wife of this Álvaro de Ornellas Saavedra, or, according to others, Ayres de Ornellas and Vasconcellos, created the entailed estate of Nossa Senhora da Consolação, also in Caniço, in 1591.\n\n(See 'Works of D.
