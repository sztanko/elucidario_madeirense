In this place, on the right bank of the Ribeira de Santa Luzia, stands the chapel of Nossa Senhora do Rosário, built by João da Paz de Castro in the year 1668. The Jesuits had a residence with a private chapel and surrounding lands there. This place had an important reservoir of drinking water, which, through an extensive aqueduct, was conveyed to the city center and especially intended for supplying the old hospital of the Misericórdia and other buildings. It was ordered to be built by the then provider, Bishop D. Fr. Joaquim de Meneses e Ataíde, in the year 1817, and directed by the engineer Paulo Dias de Almeida, being considered at the time as a valuable work from a technical point of view.",
