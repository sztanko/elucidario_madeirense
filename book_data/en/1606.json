    "body": "In the mid-19th century, a young boy from the parish of Campanário, Madeira, left for the Argentine Republic, where after a few years he acquired a great fortune and later became one of the richest men in that prosperous South American nation. However, what deserves special mention here is the astonishing activity and entrepreneurial spirit of this Madeiran, who as a merchant, colonizer of vast uncultivated territories, director of banking houses, and negotiator of high finance operations, achieved the greatest prestige and influence, extending the network of his transactions throughout Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. It was not uncommon for the governments of these countries to seek his expertise and knowledge to solve many problems closely related to the highest interests of the state. He died in the city of Buenos Aires, at an advanced age and in possession of great wealth, on December 28, 1930, known by the name of the millionaire Gonçalves. It is regrettable that he did not respond to any of the requests from Madeira to assist in some small improvements urgently needed in his native parish.",
