    "body": "He was the great-grandson of the discoverer João Gonçalves Zarco and the grandson of the 21st captain-donor João Gonçalves da Câmara. He distinguished himself greatly in Africa for his bravery and rendered good services to the homeland. However, what truly made him known, as mentioned in all the old Madeiran chronicles, was the violent and ostentatious way in which he abducted Isabel de Abreu and the sensational episodes and circumstances that occurred at that time, making this abduction a fertile subject for the chroniclers of the time and even for other writers who have dealt with it. We have already referred to this in some detail in the article dedicated to Isabel de Abreu, to which we refer the reader.\n\nAntonio Gonçalves da Câmara, who was the son of Pedro Gonçalves da Câmara and D. Joana de Eça, the queen's chamberlain, held various palatine positions, including that of the royal huntsman of King D. João I.",
