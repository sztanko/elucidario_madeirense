    "body": "This name is given in Madeira to the light layers of snow with a crystalline form that appear in the mountains after severe cold. These layers of snow result from the rapid freezing of water vapor in contact with the surfaces where they appear. The frosts or 'dente de cão' usually appear on the north coast above 600 or 700 meters, but on the south coast, we believe they are unknown within the limits of the cultivated region. When there are sharp and prolonged cold spells, the peasants usually say that 'dente de cão' is falling.",
