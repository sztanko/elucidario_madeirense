    "body": "In Madeira, the name 'Chicharos' refers to Lathyrus sativus and L. Cicera, plants of the Leguminosae family, cultivated in some gardens. Both of these plants have leaves with 2 narrow leaflets, but the upper edge of the pods, which is winged in the former, is simply channeled in the latter. Some authors attribute poisonous properties to the seeds of chicharos, but in Madeira, where L. sativus is frequently cultivated for food purposes, there is no record of such properties. The seeds of chicharos are used for soup, and the stems and leaves make good fodder, and can also be used as green manure.",
