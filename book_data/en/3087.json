    "body": "In the *Dicionário Popular*, edited by Pinheiro Chagas, we find the following about this individual: 'Portuguese jurist, native of Funchal, came to Portugal to study at the University of Coimbra, and upon returning to Madeira, was promoted to a canonry at the Cathedral of Angra. He wrote and published a Latin volume of *Commentarios de Direito Civil* and various allegations of canon law. He died in 1681, having been born in the early 17th century or at the end of the 16th century.' However, Barbosa Machado gives Ribeiro Neto as born in Angra, which we consider more likely, although we cannot affirm it in an indubitable manner. Among the works of canon law that he published, the following are cited in the *Biblioteca Lusitana*: *Alegações de direito sobre as meias conezias do Funchal*, *Officios que tachou o cabido* and *Explicaçam do privilegio de hum altar no Funchal*, all of which were published in a volume in the year 1660.",
