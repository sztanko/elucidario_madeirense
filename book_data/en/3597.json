    "body": "The remarkable cultural work created in the city of Rio de Janeiro by the Portuguese colony in 1837, known as the Portuguese Reading Room, is well known. One of its founders was the Madeiran Francisco Eduardo Alves Viana, who served as secretary of the organizing committee of that great endeavor with the utmost dedication. The merit of this foundation and the services it has provided can be assessed by its respective catalog, published in 1906 in two volumes of 1400 pages.",
