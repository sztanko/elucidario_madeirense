Jeronimo Fernando was the general governor of the archipelago, that is, between 1624 and 1634.\n\nThe book 'Arte de Furtar' (The Art of Stealing), which many wanted to attribute to Father Antonio Vieira, is not his work, but that of a writer of merit who knew how to imitate the style and language of the famous Portuguese Jesuit.",
