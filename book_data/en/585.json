    "body": "Distinguished English botanist born in Montrose in 1773 and died in London in 1858. He was in Madeira from August 4 to 7, 1802, and later organized a list of Madeiran plants, which was included in the work of Von Buch, entitled: Physicalische Beschreibung der Canarischen Inseln (Berlin, 1825). This list is mainly based on the herbariums and manuscripts of Masson, Banks, and Dr. Solander, as Roberto Brown collected few plants during his short stay on the island.",
