    "body": "The independent company no. 1 of the Republican Guard, now (1921) mixed company no. 1, was created by decree on May 10, 1919. On December 3, 1919, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, and 21 soldiers of the said guard arrived in Funchal on the Quelimane, with 11 privates belonging to the cavalry and 15 to the infantry, and this force has been increased since then, currently comprising 3 sergeants, 8 corporals, 1 corporal bugler, and 66 soldiers, commanded by a captain commanding the company, and 1 subordinate commanding the mixed section of Funchal. In this force, there are 16 Madeirans, soldiers discharged from the infantry and artillery.\n\nThe strength of the Company is not yet well determined, as it depends on the number of posts that will be established on the island. (1921)\n\nThe Republican Guard withdrew to Lisbon in 1922, on the voyages of the steamship SÃ£o Miguel in the months of April and May. In recent times, its barracks were located at Quinta Vigia, belonging to the State, where in ancient times resided the Empress of Austria and the Archduke Maximilian, later Emperor of Mexico.",
