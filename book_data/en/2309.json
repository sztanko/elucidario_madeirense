    "body": "In the town of Porto Santo, there is a chapel with a small attached house, named the Church of Miseric贸rdia. It was the seat of an ancient Brotherhood of the same name, whose date of establishment is unknown to us. Although a royal decree of April 9, 1767, approved its Statutes, it is certain that its creation dates back to an earlier period. It never had a hospital. We are unaware of the services it provided, and at present, it does not provide any assistance to the poor.",
