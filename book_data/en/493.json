Francisco, 1901, 2 vol.\n\nWe did not read the first of these works, but the second is particularly curious for the series of errors and mistakes it contains. If Mr. Biddle, who claims to be a member of three American scientific societies, also belonged to one of the many temperance societies in his country, perhaps he would have produced a more honest and accurate work than the one he dared to publish about our island.\n\nThe first edition of the book The Madeira Island was published in the city of Philadelphia in 1896 and contains the same errors and mistakes as the second edition, which is from the year 1900.",
