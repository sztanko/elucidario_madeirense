    "body": " (Cinchona succirubra, Pav.). A Rubiaceae from the Andes, Peru, and Ecuador, introduced to Madeira in 1867 by the late botanist João Maria Moniz. Out of 20 specimens that came to the island at that time, only one existed in 1909, in a farm just above the church of Santa Luzia, where it bloomed every year, although it did not produce fertile seeds. Some cinchonas that were planted in the parish of Monte had little duration there. According to the late R. T. Lowe, the locations in Madeira where the cultivation of red cinchona could possibly be attempted with good results are the Ribeiras da Metade and da Boaventura, Lombada das Vacas in S. Vicente, Montado dos Pessegueiros in Ribeira do Inferno, Ribeira Funda near Seixal, etc., etc. The Cinchona calisaya, mentioned in a work on the climate of Madeira as existing in the garden of the hospice of Princess D. Maria Amélia, was never cultivated on our island.",
