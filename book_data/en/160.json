    "body": "By decree of June 13, 1907, he was appointed civil governor of this district and took office on August 3 of the same year. In August 1907, a suspicious disease appeared in the parish of Santo Antonio and in a few days claimed the lives of 14 individuals, the same number who were affected by the disease. This illness, which greatly alarmed the population of Funchal, did not grow further due to the vigorous measures that were adopted, mainly thanks to Governor Boaventura de Almeida's promptness and effectiveness in implementing these measures, thus linking his name to the eradication of the terrible disease. He died in Lisbon on August 11, 1934.",
