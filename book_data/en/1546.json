    "body": "The well-known novelist Arnaldo Gama (1828-1869) wrote, among other books, the novel entitled A Caldeira de Pêro Botelho, whose plot takes place largely on this island, with some characters also being natives of Madeira, namely the noblemen Diogo and Pêro Botelho. Regarding the elements used to weave this historical novel, Arnaldo Gama says in a final note of his book: 'In conclusion, I must say that the story of the love affair between Diogo Botelho and D. Beatriz, as well as that of the Caldeira de Pêro Botelho, were taken from the Relation of a Journey to Spain, written by Tomé Pinheiro da Veiga, who is said to be the author of the famous Arte de Furtar, a journey of which the manuscript is owned by Mr. Antonio Rodrigues da Cruz Coutinho, owner and editor of this book'.",
