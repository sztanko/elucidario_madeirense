    "body": "A tree native to the Mediterranean region, extensively cultivated in Madeira and Porto Santo. The most appreciated figs in Madeira are the sweet, martinho, white, cotio, and bebera varieties. The latter are distinguished from the rest by their black color and elongated shape. Figs that remain in a rudimentary state over winter and develop prematurely in the following year are called \"lampos.\" In the Serra de Dentro on the island of Porto Santo, there is a large fig tree said to have been planted by the early settlers. It is undoubtedly the oldest tree on the neighboring island.",
