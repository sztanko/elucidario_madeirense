    "body": "He was born in Funchal on October 3, 1855, and died in this city on November 23, 1911. He completed his medical degree at the University of Paris in 1880. Upon returning to Madeira, on October 2 of the same year, he successfully performed a delicate surgical operation on the late prelate D. Manuel Agostinho Barreto, which immediately earned him a great reputation as a distinguished physician and surgeon. He defended and published the thesis 'Essai sur les oreillons sous-maxillaires', and in a controversy with the Count of Canavial, he published in 1884 the pamphlet 'Resposta ao folheto do dr. João da Camara Leme Homem de Vasconcellos. . .'",
