    "body": "There are two varieties of pineapples in Madeira, one with almost spineless leaves, and the other with leaves provided with strong thorns on the margins. The former is only cultivated in some greenhouses and is identical to the Azorean pineapple, known in England by the name \"Smooth-leaved Cayenne\"; the latter blooms and bears fruit well outdoors in various parts of the island, but its fruits or soroses are smaller and more acidic than those of the other variety.\n\nThe pineapple with thorny leaves, which is said to have been imported from Africa but also exists in Brazil and other countries, appears in Ribeira Brava, Porto da Cruz, Funchal, etc. Its leaves are long and often red-spotted, and its oblong-cylindrical spikes are arranged on a peduncle or stem provided with short and reddish leaves. The perianth has 6 divisions, the three outer ones are red and short, and the three inner ones are lilac, raised, narrow, and slightly shorter than the bracts.\n\nThe pineapple generally bears fruit from November to January and blooms in March and April.\n\nAnatole France. This eminent French writer, a member of the French Academy, was in Funchal on his return from South America on August 25, 1909, leaving for his country on the same day.",
