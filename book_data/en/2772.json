    "body": "Born in Madeira on April 1, 1894, he is a law graduate from the University of Lisbon, although he initially began his legal studies at the University of Coimbra. He attended the seminary of Funchal before enrolling in the law faculty. As a student, he lovingly cultivated poetry, publishing in 1913 a promising volume of verses entitled 'Canções de Tristes.' In this, reference is made to the upcoming appearance of the volumes 'A avosinha' and 'Canções da Ilha,' which it seems were not published. He has had extensive collaboration in various newspapers in Coimbra and Funchal (1921).",
