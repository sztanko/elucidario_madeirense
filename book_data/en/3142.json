    "body": "He was appointed Captain-General of Madeira in 1766, but only took office on December 9 of the following year, having carried out a good administration. As we have already seen on page 101 of this volume, he sought to put an end to many abuses that were practiced in Madeira, and for this reason, his enemies celebrated his departure from the island with illuminations and fireworks, which took place on June 10, 1777, after the fall of the Marquis of Pombal, to whom he was related. Recognizing his services, the new government honored him with the title of Baron of Alverca.",
