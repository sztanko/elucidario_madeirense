In an earlier time, the entire Murças street was called Rua do Capitão. Frutuoso says: 'From this Sabão street, there is a street called Capitam, because it is the most direct access to his house...' This captain referred to in the 'Saudades' was the captain-donor of Funchal, who had his residence in the São Lourenço fortress.",
