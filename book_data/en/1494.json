    "body": "The extinct Agricultural Board intended to establish a refrigeration plant in Funchal, acquiring a plot of land for this purpose between the old streets of Conceição and Hortas, now Correia Heredia and Alferes Veiga Pestana, for the amount of 10,500$00. The machinery for the same establishment cost 6,000$00 and in facilities, walls, opening of the communication between the two mentioned streets, etc., around 500,000 were spent until 1915. Despite being a facility capable of providing good services, the refrigeration plant never started operating, and in a session of the Agricultural Board on August 23, 1918, it was resolved to hand over to the Municipal Council the street where the buildings intended for it were constructed. (1921).",
