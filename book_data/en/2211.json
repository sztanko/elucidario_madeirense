By telegram from the Provisional Government of the Republic, on October 5, 1910, he was appointed Civil Governor of Madeira, and on the following day, he took office in this position, which was conferred upon him by an employee of the Civil Government Secretariat. By decree of February 17, 1919, he was again appointed Civil Governor of this district, assuming the position on the 19th of the same month and year, and leaving it in the following May, as he had been elected deputy for Evora. It was during the first period of his administration as Civil Governor of Funchal that the cholera epidemic manifested in this city, and at that time, Dr. José Alfredo Mendes de Magalhães (see this name) came to Madeira as High Commissioner and representative of the Central Government. In July 1921, he was elected senator for this archipelago. He had a significant collaboration in the local press, particularly in the newspaper *O Povo*, of which he was the chief editor for several years. He passed away in Funchal on April 4, 1936.",
