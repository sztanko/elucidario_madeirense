    "body": "This distinguished French physician, a renowned specialist in pulmonary diseases, was in Madeira in the months of September and October of 1881, expressly dedicating himself to the study of our climate from a therapeutic point of view, and came to the conclusion that the superiority of the climate of this island over that of other health resorts was undeniable. In his remarkable work *Curabilit√© et traitement de la phthisie pulmonaire*, he extensively discusses Madeira as a winter resort for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. These pages, which are of the utmost importance due to the unquestionable authority of the name that subscribes them, should be read and considered by those interested in the climate of this archipelago.",
