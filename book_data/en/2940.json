    "body": "In the early 19th century, a procession in honor of S. Francisco took place, as seen in an order from the Captain-General instructing to \"fire a salute in the upper square of S. Lourenço for the procession of Mr. S. Francisco... and only fire those pieces that have been ordered, which do not damage the house or the fishery.\" It is believed that the procession started from the convent of S. Francisco, established at the location of the current Municipal Garden.",
