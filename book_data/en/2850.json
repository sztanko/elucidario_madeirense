    "body": "The coastal promontory known by this name is partly located at the eastern end of the village of the same name. We read somewhere that this name comes from the circumstance of being able to see the sun from that point, all year round, from sunrise to sunset on the horizon.\n\nIn its closest vicinity, there is a small port, in front of the village and partly limited by a short beach and a small point, on which the pier is located, providing direct access to the center of the village. As this is the seat of the municipality and the district and the port serves this locality and other nearby settlements, this port has a relatively large movement of passengers and cargo, being in frequent communication, by means of coastal steamers, with the city of Funchal and some parishes on the west coast of Madeira. The pier, which is a work of certain architectural grandeur, was ordered to be built by the Municipal Council of that municipality, in the years 1848 to 1850. Some studies were made for the extension of this pier, taking advantage of the rocks found on the site, and in 1880 a project and plan of works were drawn up, which were never carried out. The first name given to this pier was Duque de Leuchtenberg, a resident in Madeira at the time of its construction.",
