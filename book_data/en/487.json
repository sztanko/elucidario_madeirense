    "body": "A rudimentary and coarse hunting and fishing device, derived from the word 'bicho'. It consists of a stick with a hook or a fishing hook at the end, used to catch seabirds in their burrows, such as cagarras, anjinhos, etc. In this case, a thin quince stick constitutes the entire device. In other cases, when formed by a robust shaft with a strong hook, it functions as a true gaff, used by fishermen to pull large fish brought to the edge of the boat inside.",
