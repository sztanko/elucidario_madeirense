In the work entitled *Reise der Oesterreichischen Fregatte Novara um die Erde* (Vienna, 1861), there is a chapter in which Commodore Wuellerstorf-Urbair pays a just tribute of his admiration to the island of Madeira, where he stayed from June 8th to 17th, 1857. This chapter, in the part that refers to our island, was translated by João Felix Pereira and published in *Lampada* (issues 25 to 37, from May 31st to September 10th, 1873), and there is also a translation by the illustrious writer José Maria Latino Coelho, which appeared in the *Revista Contemporânea* and was reproduced in the extinct *Diário do Comércio*, from Funchal.",
