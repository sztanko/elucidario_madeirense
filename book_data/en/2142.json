    "body": "The monarchs and the governments of the metropolis, united in the same mindset, gradually restricted the original and almost discretionary powers of the first grantees of this archipelago until they achieved a great centralization in public administration and in the collection of various taxes and duties. In the articles 'Doações' (vol. 1, page 368) and 'Donatários' (Vol.-I, pages 373 and 374), we have already referred in some detail to this point, recalling that the Royal Charter of April 27, 1497 (See Saudades, page 479) was one of the first and main blows struck at the privileges and exemptions of the ancient grantees. The captaincies, which were almost considered the property of the grantees, gradually became the property of the crown and true colonies of central power. It should not be understood that Madeira became 'realenga' in the sense of having entirely escaped the governmental action of the captain-grantees, but that the successive limitation given to the powers they enjoyed so curtailed their privileges and reduced their prerogatives that it can be well affirmed, with the author of Saudades, that the archipelago passed into the possession of the State, when before it was a fief and a lordship of which the grantees almost entirely enjoyed.",
