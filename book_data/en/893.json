    "body": "In the book Poetas Palacianos, Teofilo Braga dedicated some pages to various Madeiran poets of the 15th century, which the illustrious writer believed could constitute a distinct poetic cycle from that of the mainland poets, a statement with which the distinguished annotator of Saudades da Terra disagrees, presenting erudite and weighty reasons on page 770 and following of the same work. It is an interesting question that deserves to be read and appreciated by those dedicated to subjects of history and literary criticism.",
