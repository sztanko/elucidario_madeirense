    "body": "They were elected by the guilds of the working classes at the Casa dos Vinte e Quatro, and the People's Judge had to inform the Municipal Chamber of the result of the elections, so that it could issue their respective letters. In addition to the senior judge, there was sometimes a second judge, or a younger judge, and each trade, in addition to these officials, had a clerk and a flag steward. The shoemakers elected a judge for black work and one for white work, and it was customary for the clerk of the blacksmith's trade to also be the clerk of the locksmith's trade.\n\nWe know that there were Judges of the stonemason, carpenter, joiner, locksmith, blacksmith, shoemaker, boatman, tanner, barber, miller, tailor, axe carpenter, caulker, and cooper trades in Funchal.",
