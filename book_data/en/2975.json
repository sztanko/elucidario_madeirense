Taking advantage of the generous offer from a well-known collector of precious antiques and valuable works of art, the General Board of the District decided to create a Museum of Ancient Art to be installed in this manor with such noble traditions, thus endowing our land with a great improvement in the sphere of general cultural knowledge, the popularization of valuable artistic knowledge, and also as an attraction for the visitors who frequently come to our island.",
