    "body": "Tree of the Juglandaceae family, much cultivated in Madeira. It is native to Eastern Austria and Asia, and produces fruits that are initially green and then black, with the pit (walnut) grooved. The almond is the edible part of these fruits, and from it, in some countries, a drying oil is extracted, used in the arts and in domestic economy. The wood of the walnut tree is highly sought after for certain luxury works, and the bark of the tree provides a dark brown dye. The infusion of the leaves and the outer part of the fruits (epicarp and part of the mesocarp) is used internally to purify the blood.",
