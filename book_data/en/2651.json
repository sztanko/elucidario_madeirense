    "body": "(## Carica Papaya##). Woody Passifloraceae from South America, with generally single trunk and very large leaves, with 7 to 9 more or less cut segments. Its fruits are either sessile or long-pedunculated, the latter being found in individuals that produce male flowers, which almost always have a certain number of pistil-bearing flowers in Madeira. The papaya fruit is eaten raw or cooked, but it has an unpleasant taste. The trunk provides a juice that, when mixed with water, has the property of tenderizing tough meats in a few minutes. The same result can be achieved by wrapping the meats in the tree's leaves.",
