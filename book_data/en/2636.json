    "body": "Aureoled with the fame of the most exalted Christian virtues, Mother Virginia da Paixão passed away on January 17, 1929, at the Lombo dos Aguiares estate in the parish of Santo António. She was one of the last professed nuns of the former convent of Nossa Senhora das Mercês, and when that monastic house was demolished, she retired to the modest house of her relatives in the mentioned estate, where she was born in the third quarter of the last century. Even during her lifetime, and particularly after her death, the most laudatory references were made about her, going so far as to consider her a true predestined soul, to whom heaven had granted privileged gifts in the practice of the most heroic virtues. This religious figure was extensively covered in 'O Jornal' on January 17, 1941, and on January 16, 1944.",
