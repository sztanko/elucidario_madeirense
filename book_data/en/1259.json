Exclusively caught by the fishermen of Câmara de Lobos, it is a tasty fish that extensively supplies the market in Funchal. Its capture takes place at a depth of about 1000 fathoms, making it one of the deepest fisheries in the world. The swordfish, once very cheap, now sells for 60, 70, and 80 cents each in the Funchal market.",
