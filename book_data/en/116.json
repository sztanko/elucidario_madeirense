    "body": "The alcaide of Funchal was appointed by the Chamber, but while the captaincies existed, the appointment to this position could only fall on one of the three individuals proposed by the donatary. For many years, this was the alcaide-mor, and therefore the official appointed by the Senate was often referred to as the alcaide-menor, who combined functions now distributed between the Council Administrator and the Police Commissioner. There were alcaides in Câmara de Lobos, Ribeira Brava, and Caniço, at a time when these localities belonged to the Municipality of Funchal, but the duties of these officials, also appointed by the Chamber, should have been regulated by those of the current parish administrators. The last alcaide of Funchal was José Luiz Brandão, appointed in 1832.",
