    "body": "It has long been overdue to pay tribute to the first captain-donor of Funchal, thus perpetuating his venerable memory among us. Although it cannot be asserted today, as has often been claimed, that he was the discoverer of the archipelago, it is necessary to recognize that he was the most authoritative and influential promoter of the early Madeiran colonization, to which his prestigious name remains indissolubly linked. His monument stands on Avenida Arriaga, represented by a majestic bronze statue, created by the distinguished Madeiran sculptor Francisco Franco, and its solemn inauguration took place on May 28, 1934.",
