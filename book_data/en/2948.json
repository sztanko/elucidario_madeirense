He mentions the depths of Curral das Freiras, in the parish of the same name, and the most notable of all, the depths of Fanal, in the mountains of the parish of Ribeira da Janela, the depths of Rabaçal, in the valley of the aforementioned Ribeira, and the depths of Fõjo, near Praia Formosa, in the parish of São Martinho. Dr. Azevedo extensively covers all these depths in the 'Diccionario Universal Portuguez Ilustrado' (Illustrated Universal Portuguese Dictionary).",
