    "body": "A small fish from Madeira of the Gobiesocida family, common in the tidal zone, under the loose and smooth rocks left uncovered by the sea. It is interesting for its conformation, which, among other features, presents a ventral disc in the shape of a suction cup, allowing it to attach to the round stones of the coast. It has no utility.",
