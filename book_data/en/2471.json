It was founded in 1649 by Gaspar Vasconcelos Henriques and his wife D. Bernardina de Carvalho, with the deed of endowment of this chapel dated 9th February of the same year. Falling into ruins, it was rebuilt in 1758 by D. Francisco Inacio Telo de Meneses, a descendant of the founders. The new chapel was built a short distance from the old one and next to the residence, with which it communicated internally.\n\nIn the place of Referta, in Porto da Cruz, there was a chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora de Belém, which later came to be called Nossa Senhora do Socorro. See N. Senhora do Socorro (Chapels of).",
