    "body": "A fish of the Ginodonta family, which lives near the coast of Madeira and feeds on small crustaceans, which it crushes with its powerful jaws. It is caught in large quantities in the muddy bottoms with trawl nets. It has a large abdominal sac that sometimes dilates excessively, forcing it to come to the surface, where it either dies or is caught by seabirds.",
