Ticks are especially abundant in the mountain pastures of Madeira and are parasites only during part of their existence; at other times, they tend to attach themselves to shrubs, heather, and other plants, and then move on to animals and sometimes even to humans. Some parasitic arachnids are also known as ticks or carrasea.",
