    "body": "As already mentioned in the article Acciaily, it was Simão Acciaioly, the first to come to Madeira using this surname, and he belonged to one of the most distinguished families of Florence, being the son of Zenóbio Acciaioly and D. Catarina Delfina. He arrived on this island in the first quarter of the 15th century, and in 1529, he was granted a coat of arms and confirmation of his nobility. Noronha says that Simão Acciaioly married D. Maria Pimentel and died on February 15, 1544. He established the entail called Nossa Senhora do Faial or da Natividade, and was succeeded in the administration of the entail by his son Zenóbio Acciaioly. Simão Acciaioly had sugar mills and a large house in Funchal, and he held the position of almoxarife here. He built the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Piedade in the old chapter of the convent of S. Francisco, and was buried there.",
