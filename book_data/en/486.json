    "body": "On the plateau of Paul da Serra, about 10 kilometers from Rabaçal and 4 from the Casa de Abrigo do Lombo do Mouro, is the site of Bica da Cana, where the extinct Agricultural Board of Madeira created, in 1914, an Experimental Agriculture Field and carried out the testing of various crops, in which considerable sums were spent, without appreciable results.\n\nThe post established there was abandoned for several years, but the General Board of the district, through its agricultural department, has devoted its careful attention to this post, carrying out important work in the conservation and repair of the houses, in the fencing of arable land, in various agricultural experiments, etc. However, it must be confessed that the success of these works does not correspond to the expenses and efforts employed. The unfavorable climatic conditions, the altitude at which this region is located, the frequent gales that are unleashed there, and the complete exposure to which agricultural crops are subjected sufficiently explain the failure of the experiments carried out there. Only with the indispensable hedges, formed by masses of tree species, which would take many years to achieve, could perhaps achieve somewhat beneficial results, but never broadly compensating, as has already been stated in an official document.",
