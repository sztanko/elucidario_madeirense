    "body": "The inhabitants of Madeira use this name for both the species of the genus Pelargonium, cultivated in gardens, and the species of the genera Lavatera and Malva, spontaneous or subspontaneous in the archipelago. The *Pelargonium inquinans* is the most common of the Geraniaceae introduced in gardens; the Lavatera cretica, the Malva silvestris, and the M. parviflora are the dominant Malvaceae in Madeira. All these Malvaceae are emollient and are used to combat inflammations. The decoction of their flowers or leaves is used for gargling, baths, eye drops, etc.. The inhabitants of Porto Santo make ropes with the fibers obtained by trituration from the Lavatera arborea, a species cultivated and naturalized on that island.",
