    "body": "It was taken as the patroness of studies in Madeira in the late third or early last quarter of the 18th century, and therefore the students held an annual celebration in her honor, which lasted, as we believe, until 1855. At that time, there was a hill where the island's poets gathered. In September 1880, the aforementioned celebration took place in the church of the College, which had not been held for 25 years, but without the participation of the high school students, who were its main promoters in other times.",
