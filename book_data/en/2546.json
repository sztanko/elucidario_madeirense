    "body": "On July 25, 1808, the envoy of His Holiness in Lisbon arrived in Madeira, coming from London. He disembarked at Pontinha and then headed to the Cathedral, where he attended the 10 o'clock mass. After visiting the church, he got into a sedan chair and went to the episcopal palace. He left the island on the 28th, and during his short stay here, he conferred minor orders on some students, as the bishop was not in Funchal, and gave the dean the necessary powers to grant some marriage dispensations. His departure saved all the fortresses of the city.",
