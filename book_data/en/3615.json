    "body": "In tracing a brief biographical sketch of our illustrious compatriot Jaime Constantino de Freitas Moniz, we referred to the eloquent speech he delivered at the trial of Dr. José Cardoso Vieira de Castro (volume II, page 382), after the lamentable tragedy that deprived the country of the services of this astonishing talent and distinguished parliamentarian. Dr. Vieira de Castro passed through our port, aboard the steamship D. Antónia, in the first days of September in the year 1871, bound for Luanda to serve the sentence pronounced by the court that convicted him. Several people from this city went to greet him on board. The Madeiran journalist João Augusto de Ornelas (volume III, page 21) published a pamphlet entitled A Coroa de Ouro, o que foi e o que é José Cardoso Vieira de Castro, which we never managed to see.\n\nDr. José Cardoso Vieira de Castro was the uncle of Henrique Vieira de Castro, whom we discuss in this Elucidário.",
