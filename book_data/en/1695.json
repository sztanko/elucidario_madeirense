    "body": "These Muscineas are represented in the Madeira archipelago by 76 species, as stated by Miss Armitage in her work entitled Some Madeira Hepaticae. They are small plants that live in moist places, on tree trunks, in the soil, on walls, and on rocks, and they appear either with stems and leaves or entirely devoid of these organs. Among the Madeiran Hepatics, we will mention - Madotheca canariensis, M. Thuja, Frullania polysticta, F. Teneriffae, Anthocerus dichotomus, Aitonia rupestris, Saccogyna viticulosa, Plagiochila spinulosa, Lunularia cruciata, and Marchantia polymorpha. See Armitage, Mitten, Godman, and Luisier.",
