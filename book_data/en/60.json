    "body": "Among Zarco's companions on the voyage of the discovery of Madeira, in addition to Tristão Vaz, the chronicles have preserved the names of Gonçalo Aires Ferreira, João Lourenço, Rui Pais, and João Afonso, all belonging to noble families and who became the ancestors of extensive lineages on this island. Upon arriving at Machico Bay and making the first landing there, they continued the next day to explore the coast, while the ships remained anchored in that port. Frutuoso mentions the boats led by Gonçalves Zarco, Tristão Vaz, and João Afonso, who, leaving Machico Bay, traveled along the entire south coast of Madeira on an exploratory journey. The frequent references to João Afonso seem to indicate that he stood out from his companions due to some influence or prestige he had over them. João Afonso had sesmaria lands in Câmara de Lobos and established a majorat, to which he annexed the chapel of the Holy Spirit in the Church of Nossa Senhora do Calhau, where he was buried in the last quarter of the 15th century. He is the founder of the Torre Bela house, one of the oldest and most important in Madeira. In this island, he held the position of almoxarife of Infante D. Henrique, collecting the revenues and taxes destined for him.",
