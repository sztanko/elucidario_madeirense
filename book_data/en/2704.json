    "body": "A fish of the Escombrida family, rare in the vicinity of Madeira, although some authors mention it as common. It is, due to its brilliant color, one of the most beautiful species in the Atlantic and has a compressed body, reaching just over a meter. It is caught between 75 and 200 fathoms, usually with the tuna line. During the day, it stays offshore, but at night it approaches the coast somewhat.",
