When we dealt at some length with Christopher Columbus's stay in Madeira (I-286 and ss.), we made reference to the house where he lived on Rua do Esmeraldo and to the famous window that belonged to that building, now artistically and devotedly placed in the garden of Quinta Palmeira and preserved there with the greatest veneration and appreciation by its current owner.",
