    "body": "He was born on this island around 1815. In 1839, he graduated in mathematics from the University of Coimbra, after a course in which he obtained the highest grades and was invited to be a lecturer, which he declined. He then graduated from the Faculty of Medicine of the same University. He competed for the position of lecturer of the mechanics chair at the Polytechnic School, in which, through public tests, he showed the value of his high faculties and his profound knowledge, being the first classified in that competition. He was appointed as a lecturer, but we do not know if he came to teach the chair, because his weak organization, extremely depleted by the excessive work of the competition, forced him to abandon the study, dying in this city on July 22, 1847, at the age of just over 30 years.",
