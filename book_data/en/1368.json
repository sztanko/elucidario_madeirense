    "body": "He was born in this city on May 26, 1824, the son of Severiano Alberto de Freitas Ferraz and D. Leonor Filomena Ferraz. He graduated from a higher engineering school in Paris. In the exercise of his profession as an engineer, he left his name linked to major works, such as those of the artificial port of Ponta Delgada and the building of the Penitentiary of Lisbon. From 1866 to 1870, he was the director of the works at that port and wrote a report on how he directed the respective construction works. He went abroad to conduct special studies on the various penitentiary systems and prisons for criminals sentenced to longer terms, in order to guide the construction works of the Penitentiary of Lisbon, works that he planned, designed, and directed until the almost final completion of this great building. The way he carried out these important works sparked some discussions in the press. Among the positions he held in Lisbon was that of director of the Water Company. He represented Madeira in the legislative session of 1879. He died in Funchal on December 24, 1880.",
