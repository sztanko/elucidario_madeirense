    "body": "A climbing plant with short lateral roots. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is very common in Madeira, where it is used for hedges and to cover walls. Ivy water is used for washing and dyeing black fabrics. The ropes called 'hera' are made not with the fibers, but with the thin and flexible branches of the plant. It is with these ropes that the grape pomace is held in the winepresses.",
