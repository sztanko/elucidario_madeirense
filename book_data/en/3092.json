    "body": "One of the most worthy points to be visited in Rabaçal due to the majestic panoramas that can be enjoyed from there. Its name comes from the risk that the workers ran to carry out the construction work of the duct on the high and sheer rock where the water falls. The Risco well, located at the bottom of the ravine and about 80 meters below the levada, also deserves to be visited, but it cannot be reached without some effort. The waters of Risco come from a lagoon or excavation located on the edge of Paul da Serra.",
