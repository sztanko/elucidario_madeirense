These granulations, as Dr. Alfredo Ernesto Rodrigues, a specialist in eye diseases, tells us, appear very frequently in individuals from Paul do Mar. The esteemed clinician from Funchal, Dr. Fortunato Pita, wrote an interesting article in the contemporary Medicine (Year XLI, no. 21, January 21, 1923) titled The Treatment of trachomatous conjunctivitis by heliotherapy, in which the following is read: 'The sun is applied in the morning, it can be every day or not, depending on the circumstances, with the exposure time being 1 to 2 minutes, more or less (1921).'",
