    "body": "It is a very ancient family name among us, as it comes from Bartolomeu Perestrelo, the first grantee and settler of Porto Santo. He was the son of Filipone or Felipe Perestrelo, who genealogists say came to Portugal in the late 14th century, being a native of Placencia, in Lombardy, and the son of Gabriel Perestrelo, a nobleman whose privileges were recognized in our country. The shield of this family is described as follows: 'shield divided in pale; in the first, on a gold field, a purple lion armed in red; in the second, on a silver field, a blue band, charged with three eight-pointed stars between six red tosas, three by three in pale; crest the lion of the shield, with a star on the shoulder'.",
