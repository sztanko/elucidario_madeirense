    "body": "A European tree of the Rosaceae family, sub-family Prunoideas, cultivated in Serra de Agua, Curral, Ponta do Pargo, etc. The Madeiran cherries are subglobose, red or black, and have a pleasant taste; they ripen in June and July. The cherry stems are widely used in infusion as a diuretic. The cultivation of the black cherry tree was prohibited in 1788 by Governor D. Diogo Pereira Forjaz Coutinho, on the grounds that the fruits of this tree were used to color wines.",
