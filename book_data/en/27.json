    "body": "This was the name of an extensive area now occupied by Campo do Almirante Réis (formerly Campo de D. Carlos). The square derived its name from the proceeds of a performance given by the Funchal Academy at the Bom Gosto theater to celebrate the marriage of Queen D. Maria II in 1837. This area was recently embellished with a small lake, garden, seating, etc., and the Municipal Council erected a building there for a children's playground for underprivileged children, which was inaugurated in 1939 under the name of D. Maria Lívia Nosolini.",
