    "body": "In September 1757, there was a famine in Madeira due to a shortage of bread. According to a letter written by Governor Manuel Saldanha da Gama to Tomé Joaquim da Costa Corte Real, in some parts of the island, the people only ate roots, broom flowers, and fruits, but the crisis was short-lived, as by the following November, the island was already supplied with cereals. It is curious that the people used broom flowers in their diet when they had many plants, such as watercress, sorrel, turnips, purslane, and even nettles and sow thistles, which had a more pleasant taste than the aforementioned flowers.\n\nIn 1757, wheat had not yet been introduced to Madeira, but sweet potatoes were already being cultivated here, although we do not know if it was on the same scale as it is today.",
