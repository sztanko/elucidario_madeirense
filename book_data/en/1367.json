    "body": "The annotator of the 'Saudades da Terra' mentions this priest as one of the most distinguished sacred orators of this diocese in the last century. He was born in Funchal in 1823 and died in Lisbon on July 31, 1859. His illness and premature death did not allow him to reveal the full power of his talent and the remarkable aptitudes he had for preaching, but, despite this, he was considered in his time as a brilliant ornament of the pulpit not only in Madeira, but throughout the country. He had the honors of a canon and was the curate of the Cathedral of this city. He died in Lisbon, where he had gone to seek improvement in his health, falling victim to pulmonary tuberculosis.",
