    "body": "He was a friar at the convent of São Francisco in Funchal and was highly renowned in his time as a preacher and a man of broad enlightenment. We know of two speeches that he published in Funchal in 1823, one preached at the church of São Martinho and another titled 'Thanksgiving Prayer preached at the cathedral church of Sé do Funchal on July 8, 1823, on the occasion of the solemn festivity... for the happy restoration of our king to the throne of his august ancestors... Funchal, 1823'. These speeches are extremely rare.",
