    "body": "D. Manuel Martins Manso was the 24th bishop of Funchal, having been at the helm of the administration of this diocese from November 16, 1850, to June 13, 1858. He was born in the municipality of Mogadouro on November 21, 1793, and died in the city of Guarda on December 1, 1878. In 1819, he completed his canon law degree at the University of Coimbra and was ordained a priest in 1822. In 1824, he was appointed vicar general of Bragança, where he served as vicar capitular and governor of the diocese on several occasions. Presented as bishop of Funchal on April 18, 1849, he was confirmed by the Holy See on May 28, 1850, and received episcopal consecration on October 8 of the same year. Referring to this prelate, Dr. Álvaro Rodrigues de Azevedo said: 'humble and virtuous, Bishop Martins Manso was the Good Shepherd in the diocese of Funchal and acted in the same way in the diocese of Guarda, to which he was transferred in 1858.' During the eight years he presided over the affairs of the Funchal church, he always showed great zeal in fulfilling his episcopal duties, leaving behind the most honorable traditions. Even today, his prudence, gentleness, and evangelical spirit in managing the affairs of this bishopric are remembered, earning him widespread sympathy, which made his departure for the diocese of Guarda deeply felt.",
