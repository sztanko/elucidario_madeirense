    "body": "This name is known in Madeira for *Lepidium virginicum*, *L. sativum*, and *Cronopus didymus*, plants of the Cruciferae family, the first two being subspontaneous and the last indigenous. The *Coronopus didymus* and the *Lepidium virginicum*, easily recognizable, the former by its erect stems, its toothed upper leaves, and its suborbicular, reniform siliques, and the latter by its highly incised leaves and its siliques wider than long, are very common in Madeira, while the L. sativum, with broadly winged siliques, only exists in S. Roque. All these species are antiscorbutic, and the latter can be eaten in salads. The juice of the leaves of Cronopus didymus is used externally in the treatment of certain skin ailments.",
