    "body": "Three trees of the Salicaceae family are designated by this name in Madeira: Populus alba, with white-tomentose leaves on the lower side, often palmately lobed; P. nigra var. italica, with a pyramidal crown and triangular-ovate leaves; and P. monilifera, with a broad crown and leaves similar to those of the previous species. The first, originating from Europe, is common in Ribeira Brava, Machico, etc.; the second, originating from the East, is also called poplar and is found in Camacha; the third, originating from North America, is cultivated in some squares and estates and is a good shade tree. Poplars multiply easily from cuttings, and their wood has various applications.",
