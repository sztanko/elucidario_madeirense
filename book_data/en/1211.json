    "body": "A fish of the Leptocephalidae family, common in the lower parts of some streams and ponds in Madeira. Although it has a pleasant taste, it is not the subject of any trade, and its fishing is, at most, a simple pastime for the young people.\n\nThe eir贸 reproduces in the sea, where it retreats at certain times. The young eir贸s, after passing through the leptocephalus stage, live for some time in saltwater, only returning to the ponds and streams after reaching a certain stage of development.",
