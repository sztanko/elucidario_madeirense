    "body": "He was born in the parish of Ponta Delgada on December 5, 1827, the son of Captain António Joaquim Gonçalves de Freitas and Eulalia Cândida de Freitas, and died in Lisbon on July 14, 1875. He graduated in law from the University of Coimbra in 1848, after obtaining various distinctions and proving to be a very talented and dedicated student. From 1852 to 1860, he practiced law in Funchal and dedicated himself to politics and journalism. He was a deputy for Madeira in the three legislative sessions from 1860 to 1865. He settled in the capital, where he held various public positions, including that of director general of direct taxes. He was considered a great authority in public finance administration, in which he specialized. He was invited more than once to take on a ministerial position, at a time when not everyone could, but he always refused to accept such a responsibility. He enjoyed great prestige in Lisbon, not only for his intellectual gifts and recognized competence, but also for the austere qualities of character that ennobled his spirit. He was one of the most distinguished Madeirans of the 19th century.",
