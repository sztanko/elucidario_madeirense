    "body": "There are several species of the genus *Jasminum* in Madeira, two of which – *J. odoratissimum* and *J. azoricum*, are indigenous. The first of these Oleaceae, which generally has 3-foliate leaves and yellow flowers, is found in S. Gonçalo, Caniço, etc.; the second, which also has 3-foliate leaves, but with larger leaflets, and white flowers, has only been found in the vicinity of Serra de Água. The *J. grandiflorum* from Malabar, and the *J. revolutum* from India, are cultivated in gardens, the former having white flowers, and the latter yellow flowers. The *Trachelospermum jasminoides* is also known in Madeira by the name Jasmine Tree, although it belongs to the Apocynaceae family.",
