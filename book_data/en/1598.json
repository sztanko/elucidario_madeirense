    "body": "He is the current representative of Portugal in England (1921). He visited Madeira years ago and traveled a part of the island, giving an account of his excursions in the second edition of his book *Cartas sem moral nenhuma*, from page 159 to 239. He refers with great enthusiasm to the triptych in the sacristy of the church of S. Pedro, saying that 'as types, I know nothing superior in any painting, and the composition, the coloring, the drawing are certainly from a very powerful artist.' The viscount of Meireles dealt with the references made by Teixeira Gomes in articles published in the Heraldo da Madeira, highlighting the beauties of those paintings. Teixeira Gomes affirms that he was the discoverer of this marvel, and indeed we do not know of any other individual who had previously referred to these unknown canvases.",
