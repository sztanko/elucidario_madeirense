    "body": "It is one of the most important watercourses on this island. It serves as the dividing line between the parishes of São Martinho and Santo Antonio on the left bank, and Câmara de Lobos and Estreito de Câmara de Lobos on the right bank. São Martinho and Câmara de Lobos border the mouth of the stream. It originates in the interior of the island, in the place called Torrinhas, and crosses the parish of Curral das Freiras. During the first exploration made along the coast by João Gonçalves Zargo, some of his companions who disembarked at the mouth of this stream were being dragged by the force of the current. The captain promptly came to their aid, and \"they were rescued and free from danger... and from this the name... Ribeira dos Socorridos remained, as the author of Saudades says.\"",
