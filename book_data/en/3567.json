    "body": "Almost in front of the old Dificuldades Street, there was once a very curious wooden building known as Vapor, whose ends rested on the two banks of the Santa Luzia stream. It had only one floor, was painted red, and was originally intended as a tavern and bathhouse, serving as a residence for some poor families in its final years. It was built in 1837 and, as far as we believe, demolished in 1898, as it was very dilapidated. It was common to see many of the foreigners who spent the winter here reproducing by drawing or painting the extravagant construction that existed over the Santa Luzia stream.",
