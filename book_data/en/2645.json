    "body": "The Palm family is represented in Madeira by various species, none of which are indigenous. The most widespread currently are the Phoenix dactylifera, originating from North Africa, and the Ph. Jubae, originating from the Canary Islands. The latter has dark green leaves, while the former has grayish-green leaves. The dates of the Canary palm tree are smaller than those of the Desert palm tree, and their pits are not elongated, as is the case with the latter species. The *Ph. jubae* is cultivated in the municipal garden and in the estates to the east and west of Funchal; the *Ph dactylifera* appears in many locations in the lower zone of Madeira, and also in Porto Santo. The fruits of the Desert palm tree only reach perfect ripeness after falling in the latter island. In addition to the two mentioned palm trees, the *Trachycarpus excelsus*, the *pritchardia filifera*, the *Latania borbonica*, the *Seaforthia elegans*, etc., etc., are found in Madeira.",
