    "body": "The Madeirans call *Centrophorus squamosus* the white xara and *Centroscymnus coelolepis* the black xara, these fish belonging to the Squalidae family and reaching a length of 1 meter or a little more. The white xara is usually smaller than the black xara, according to the fishermen who have caught these species. Xaras are used for food and have a taste similar to cod. Fishermen sometimes sell the meat of the blue shark (*Charcharias glaucus*) as xara.",
