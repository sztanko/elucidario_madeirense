    "body": "He was the 3.1 bishop of Funchal and one of the most illustrious prelates of his time. The contemporary Madeiran chronicles do not mention anything noteworthy about this head of the Funchal church, as he never came to his bishopric, due to the high positions he held on the mainland of the kingdom, such as lecturer at the University of Coimbra, president of the Mesa da Consciencia e Ordens, theologian of D. João III at the famous Council of Trent, etc. He was one of the wisest Portuguese of his time and left many works, almost all written in Latin.\n\nHe was appointed bishop of this diocese by Pope Julius II in 1551, and took office in the following year by the vicar general and provisor Dr. Antonio da Costa, who was also the governor of the bishopric. A few years later, he was transferred to the diocese of Leiria and then to Coimbra, where he was an eminent prelate in both bishoprics.\n\nHe was born in Santarém in 1512 and died in Coimbra on August 9, 1584.\n\nMany works extensively cover Fr. Gaspar do Casal, who was undoubtedly one of the most illustrious men of his time.",
