The original construction did not have the first battery that exists there: the original gateway is inside this, and has at the top, in the letter of the time, the era of 1614, to testify to the time of the work”. The São Tiago fortress was rebuilt in 1767, as seen from an inscription above the main gate, in the east-south corner of the entrance square, with the governor and captain-general José Correia de Sá having brought 50 pieces of artillery with all their belongings from London for its defense. Mountain Artillery Battery No. 3 is quartered at São Tiago Fortress. See Fortifications.",
