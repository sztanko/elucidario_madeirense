    "body": "## about Madeira\n. There are numerous verse compositions that sing and exalt the beauties of Madeira's landscape, the wonderful ruggedness and the capricious relief of its soil, the incomparable benignity of its climate, the variety, charm, and fragrance of its flowers, etc. It is completely impossible to gather them all and even to make a selection of those that stand out the most for the loftiness of the concept or the refinement of the form. We only want to refer to the poems that exclusively focus on this archipelago and they are as follows:\n*Insulana*, by Manuel Tomás. . . , Antwerp, 1635;\n*Zargueida*. . ., by Francisco de\nPaulo Medina e Vasconcelos, Lisbon, 1806;\n*The Ocean Flower...*, by T. M. Hugues, London, 1845; and\n*Auto da Lenda*, by J. Brito\nCamara, 1943. In other places of this Elucidário, there are references to these three poems, one of which is written in the English language, and some biographical data regarding their authors.\n",
