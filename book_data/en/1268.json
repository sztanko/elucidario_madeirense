    "body": "Describing the exploration carried out by the discoverers across the island for the division of the captaincies, Gaspar Frutuoso says: '... João Gonsalves Zarco... reaching a high point above Câmara de Lobos, marked the place where a church of the Holy Spirit should be built... and he took all these high points for his heirs.' This chapel, which was rebuilt several times, still exists and is in good condition. It was founded by the discoverer of Madeira and served as the parish church for many years, when in 1430 the parish of Câmara de Lobos was created. In 1720, it was rebuilt due to its advanced state of ruin, and in 1908, significant repairs were also made there and in the small adjacent house. Although perhaps nothing remains of the original building, this chapel is a small historical monument for the municipality and parish of Câmara de Lobos, recalling the name of the discoverer of Madeira, who ordered its construction, and also because it was the seat of the parish installation on the occasion of its creation, as already mentioned. In the area of Campo de Baixo on the island of Porto Santo, there is the chapel of the Holy Spirit, which is well preserved and where religious acts are practiced. It is not a recent construction and was completely restored in the first quarter of the last century by Captain Sebastião Antonio Drumond.",
