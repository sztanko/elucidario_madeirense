    "body": "It is commonly called Largo das Babosas. The new name comes from the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição erected there in 1906, especially intended to commemorate the semi-centenary of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, and which became known by the name of Capela-Monumento. The erection of this Chapel is mainly due to Comendador Luiz Betencourt Miranda, secretary of the Funchal City Council. From this square, there is a stunning view over the Ribeira de João Gomes and Curral dos Romeiros.",
