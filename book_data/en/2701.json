    "body": "A fish of the Triglidae family, common in the seas of Madeira. It varies greatly in color and has a strangely shaped head, which makes this species distinct from all others that come to market. The skull is covered with spiny protrusions, among which there are some that exude a poison secreted by special glands located in the head. A sting from one of these spines can have serious consequences. The fish is sedentary and inhabits rocky bottoms. The flesh is white and somewhat tough, but of pleasant flavor.",
