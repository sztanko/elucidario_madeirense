    "body": "The landowner of Funchal was the alcaide-mor in the captaincy, but the Filipino government entrusted the castle guard to its delegates in the archipelago, who by this fact began to use that title. The duties of these new alcaides were established by the regulation of December 5, 1603, recorded in the Municipal Archive, with the governor-general João Fogaça being the first alcaide-mor appointed by the said government.\n\nThe alcaides had the custody of the prisoners and half of the fines, in addition to other revenues indicated in the regulation.\n\nThe landowner of Funchal became a simple alcaide-mor in the captaincy, since the extinction of the land grant in 1766, but their rights and duties were very different from those of the alcaides-mores created by the Castilian government.\n\n## Municipalities and Landowners.",
