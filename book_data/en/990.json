    "body": "The revolution that broke out in the country in 1836 with the aim of repealing the Constitutional Charter promulgated in 1826, led to the restoration of the Constitution of 1820, which was sworn by the sovereign on September 10, 1836. In Madeira, the solemn oath of this Constitution took place on September 25 of the same year. After the constituent courts were elected, a new constitution was organized in 1838, which was solemnly sworn in this island on May 6 of the same year. This Constitution only remained in force until 1842, when the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was restored once again.",
