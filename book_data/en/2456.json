Maria de Noronha, who was married to João Gonçalves da Câmara, the second captain-donatary of Funchal; and a third that descends from D. Luísa Agostinha de Noronha, daughter of Manuel Freire de Noronha. We believe the second branch is the noblest.\n\nManuel de Noronha, son of the aforementioned João Gonçalves da Câmara and D. Maria de Noronha, was granted the land that later became the Quinta dos Padres da Companhia.",
