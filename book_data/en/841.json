From there, the ground descends, and only at the beginning is it necessary to pass bent over. The air is humid and suffocating, and the darkness is so intense that it is only brightened by the light of many torches. It follows a corridor, then a vast high and wide chamber, then another corridor, and at the end an opening and depth. In this journey, about 92 meters are covered among rough and uneven walls and under protrusions that burst from the vault, covered with a black and shiny crust.\n\nThe Furna do Cavalum is located near Quinta Sant’Ana, in Machico.",
