His son João de França, who was the one who introduced this surname to the island, had a lot of property and a good house in Estreito, being the founder of the original church of this parish, where he made the seat of the morgadio he instituted. He died in 1511 and was buried in the church of which he was the founder and patron. The last representative of this morgadio, one of the largest on the island, was the count of Calçada, who died in 1906.",
