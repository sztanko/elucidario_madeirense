    "body": "It is the limpet that is abundant in the Selvagens Islands and is almost extinct in Madeira. This is what the fishermen and the shearwater hunter, who uses its shell for scraping pigskin due to its large size and sharp edges, call it. It serves the same purpose as the so-called 'pedra de porco', a very vesicular basalt stone that is also suitable for scraping those animals due to its roughness. This limpet has the shape of a traveler's helmet and its interior is often lined with a beautiful egg yolk yellow.",
