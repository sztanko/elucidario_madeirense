    "body": "He was born on the island of Terceira in the year 1834. For several years, he resided in Funchal, serving as a military doctor. In 1872, he was appointed interim professor at the Medical-Surgical School of this city and as a doctor at the hospital of the Misericórdia. A serious conflict arose between him and the Administrative Commission of the Santa Casa, leading Dr. Acursio Ramos to publish a pamphlet in 1874 entitled\n\n> The Hospital of Santa Isabel in the city of Funchal seen in the light of hygiene\n\n. In 1880, he published the work\n\n> Ilha da Madeira\n\n, in Lisbon, in two volumes, of 276 and 200 pages. He left other printed works.\n\nHaving become involved in the political struggles of Madeira, his enemies managed to have Colonel Antonio Augusto de Macedo e Couto have him imprisoned on the islet on the accusation of attempting to cause anarchy in the 12th Hunters Battalion and of being the mastermind behind a Masonic conspiracy aimed at handing over the island to the Americans, sending him from there to Lisbon, where he was admitted to the Castle of São Jorge and later to the tower of São Julião da Barra. Having been arrested on April 19, 1874, it was only on December 8 of the same year that Dr. Acursio managed to regain his freedom, after the investigation council of the ridiculous process instigated against him by the aforementioned Colonel Macedo e Couto declared that there was no basis for a court-martial. He died in Lisbon on September 14, 1892.",
