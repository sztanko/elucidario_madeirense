    "body": "Among the fishermen of Madeira, it means to fish with a trolling line. It also means, in familiar language, to quickly make short trips in various directions.\n\n## See Trolling.\n\nA fishing method used in Madeira, which consists of pulling a boat, carrying one or two lines with a hook at the end, where the bait is fixed, which by the movement is forced to slide not far from the water surface. The bicuda, the enchova, and the serralh√£o are the species that best adapt to this fishing system, carried out at night, but exceptionally the caneja and other fish are caught, which have the habit of swimming near the sea surface. The bait is almost always a small whole fish, which is the main difference from 'corripo', a method adopted in Portugal, where a piece of white cloth, called a sample, is used as bait, which the deceived fish takes for a tasty bait.",
