    "body": "A fish of the Percidae family, rarely caught in the seas of Madeira. It inhabits rocky bottoms between the coast and a depth of about 150 fathoms. It does not migrate, and its breeding has been found near the coast, in shallow water. It is caught with hook and line, and its flavor, although not particularly delicate, is not considered unpleasant by less discerning palates.",
