    "body": "A large fish of the Xiphidae family, occasionally caught in the seas near Madeira. Its dimensions reach up to 4 meters in length. The robust musculature and the particular conformation of the upper jaw, elongated in the form of a spur, make it a formidable enemy, even for the most powerful inhabitants of the sea. Madeiran fishermen have risked their lives when a swordfish pierces the side of their boat with its formidable weapon. The flesh is white and of very acceptable flavor, reminiscent of tuna. See Swordfish.",
