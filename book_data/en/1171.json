This work was partially translated by J. de Meneses, and the translation was titled: A Winter in Madeira, California, 1896, 1 vol..\n\nThis translation includes some small notes at the end clarifying the text, which the translator says belong to a distinguished Madeiran publicist. Despite the inaccuracies and erroneous assessments it may contain, Dix's book is one of the foreign works written about Madeira in which the author shows the greatest impartiality and desire to be fair to the Madeiran things and people.",
