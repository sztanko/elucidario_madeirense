    "body": "In the article concerning the parish of Serra de Água and in the article 'Madeiras' (II-373), we have already dealt with the 'machines' or 'engenhos' that were built on the banks of the most abundant streams, used in sawing the woods, especially those destined for export to mainland Portugal and even abroad. An opuscule 'Serras de Água' by the distinguished Madeiran Dr. Jordão Apolinario de Freitas provides interesting information on the legislation that regulated this subject.",
