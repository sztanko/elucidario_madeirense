    "body": "English ship that entered the port of Funchal on November 24, 1884, with the purpose, as declared by the captain, of taking refreshments and providing the passengers with knowledge of our land. After the customs authorities learned, days later, that the Tybumia had a lot of cargo on board that was intended to be unloaded without paying duties, the captain was invited to present the respective manifest and the ship was closely guarded with all fiscal rigor. However, these measures only prevented the goods from being unloaded, as the Tybumia, dropping anchor on the night of December 2 of that year, unexpectedly fled from our port, where it had lingered for a few days, waiting for the opportunity to carry out the smuggling. The fortress of Ilh√©u fired some cannon shots at the smuggler ship to force it to return to the anchorage, but the bullets did not hit the target. On board the Tybumia were, among other passengers, two women who, due to their distinctive attire and manners, were initially taken by the inhabitants of Funchal as ladies of the highest English aristocracy!",
