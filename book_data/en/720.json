    "body": "The Agricultural Board established an experimental farm in each of the following locations: Louros (Funchal), Ribeira Brava, Paul da Serra, and Pôrto da Cruz. The experimental farm in the latter location lasted a short time; as for the others, the one that yielded the best results was the one in Ribeira Brava, which distributed a large number of selected fruit tree specimens to the farmers. At Paul da Serra, good harvests of seeds, cabbages, turnips, carrots, cucumbers, lettuces, beans, peas, and beetroots were obtained.",
