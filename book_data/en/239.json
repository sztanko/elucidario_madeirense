It is a very sought-after bait by fishermen for catching the parrotfish.\n\nAlso known as sea spiders, some triangular crustaceans of the genus Stenorynchus are found in deeper water and are regurgitated by the wreckfish, the blackspot seabream, and others when the fisherman removes these fish from the hook of the gear.",
