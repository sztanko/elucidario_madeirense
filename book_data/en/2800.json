Among us, he was a professor and vice-rector of the Seminary, vicar-general, and at times, governor of the diocese, having performed other service commissions, such as president of the Administrative Commission of the Holy House, etc. He was a man of broad knowledge and great dedication to study, especially well-versed in theological matters, of which he was a distinguished professor. In addition to his intellectual gifts, he possessed great austerity of character, which earned him the consideration and esteem of his fellow countrymen.
