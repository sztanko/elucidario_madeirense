    "body": "In Madeira, the _Visnea mocanera_ of the Ternstroemiaceae family and the _Pittosporum coriaceum_ of the Pittosporaceae family are known by this name. The first species is shrubby or tree-like, with hairy leaves when young, mainly on the edges and midrib of the lower side; the second is always tree-like, with leaves devoid of hair at all ages. This species is almost extinct in the mountains of Madeira but is cultivated in the estates of Monte and Camacha; the former can be found on the rocks between Ribeira da Janela and Ribeira do Inferno, although it is quite rare. The wood of the _Visnea mocanera_ is dull in color, sometimes tending towards red, very heavy and hard; that of the _Pittosporum coriaceum_ is light, yellowish, or grayish.",
