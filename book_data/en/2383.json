The mosquito that seems to be most common in Madeira is the Culex longiareolatus, which lives near wells and tanks, where its larvae develop. It sometimes frequents the bedrooms, and its buzzing is quite annoying. The *Culex pipiens* has been noted in Porto Santo, but not in Madeira. The bite of *Culex longiareolatus* causes itching and sometimes temporary edema.",
