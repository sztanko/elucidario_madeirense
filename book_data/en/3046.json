His sons William and Alfred Reid, who continued their father's business, wrote a small work in 1881 entitled Madeira, a guide book of useful and varying information, but their main service to the island consisted of the offer they made to the Municipal Library of Funchal, of nearly 10,000 volumes from the library of the late Madeiran João Joaquim de Freitas.",
