    "body": "A few years ago, and after 1905, a translation was published in Lisbon by Henrique Braga of the work of the illustrious Italian writer and psychologist Paulo Mantegazza, entitled *A Page of Love (A Day in Madeira)*, which is a work of pure fiction overall, but contains some interesting pages about Madeira, which deserve to be read, especially for the beauty of the language and the originality of its plot. The translation is based on the 24th Italian edition, and is one of the works that contain references to this archipelago that has achieved the highest number of editions, solely due to the renowned name of the author and the passionate love story that unfolds throughout the work. The book concludes with a brief note about Madeira and a chapter with a review of various works that deal with this island. Both offer some interest, despite the inaccuracies they contain.",
