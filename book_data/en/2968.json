    "body": "This public road establishes communication between Jo√£o Tavira Street and Ferreiros Street, or Comercio Street. It was formerly known as Oliveira Street and later as Afonso Vaz Street.\n\nParallel to it and a short distance away, to the north, is Gomes Freire Street (formerly Bishop's Street) and to the south is Queimada de Baixo Street. Most of the stables for renting horses, oxen, and mules used for transporting carts and carriages are found in these streets. The local press has extensively addressed the removal of these stables from the central part of the city many times. Despite the efforts made by some city councils, it has not yet been possible to remove these true sources of infection from there, which greatly affect the area and contribute to the unhealthiness of those streets (1921).",
