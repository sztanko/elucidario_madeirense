    "body": "A member of the Procellariidae family, which comes to breed in the Selvagens during the spring. This elegant little bird appears there at the end of winter, staying until July or August, when it returns south. The egg is laid at the bottom of a winding underground gallery and consists of a single white egg with small purplish spots, which sometimes cover the entire surface, while at other times they accumulate around the thicker end. In Selvagem Grande, it is preyed upon by a mouse that is abundant there, which not only attacks it but also devours its egg. The breeding of this bird has only been found in two almost diametrically opposed points on earth: the Selvagens and the western coast of Australia.",
