    "body": "The Hypericum perforatum and H. humifusum are known by this name, perennial plants of the Hypericaceae family, with yellow flowers and small transparent dots on the leaves. The first of these species, also known as St. John's wort and malfurada, has firm stems, often erect, and narrow, linear-oblong or elliptical leaves, distinctly acute; the second has filiform and prostrate stems, and small, ovate or oblong leaves, more or less obtuse. Both of these species are common in Madeira, and the infusion of their leaves is recommended for kidney and bladder ailments. Hypericum Androsaemum does not exist in Madeira.",
