All these species are whitish-tomentose and have large, serrated leaves in V.\nsinuatum, entire or only toothed in V.\nthapsus and V.\nfloccosum, the latter species being easily distinguished from the others by its very deciduous tomentum. The yellow flowers and the leaves of the mulleins are emollient.",
