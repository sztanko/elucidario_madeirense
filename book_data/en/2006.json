    "body": "All Iridaceae of the genus Iris cultivated in Madeira are known by this name. The Iris biflora, originating from Portugal and easily recognizable by its large, white or purple flowers, is the most common plant of the same genus. The Madeirans also call Reseda Luteola by the name 'lírio', a plant from the Resedaceae family, very common on the island. This plant contains a yellow coloring principle, which the Madeirans usually use by picking the flowering specimens and boiling them with what they want to dye, and finally subjecting the dyed object to an ash bath. The 'lírio' should be picked shortly after flowering and when there are already some mature seeds.",
