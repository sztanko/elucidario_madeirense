    "body": "The first consulate in Madeira was the Belgian consulate, or that of the Flemish, established in 1608, followed by the French, English, and Spanish consulates, established respectively in 1626, 1658, and 1667. In 1791, the consulate of the United States of North America was established, in 1796 that of Sweden, in 1804 that of Denmark, in 1812 that of Russia, and in 1826 or 1827 that of Sardinia, with all the other consulates that now exist in Madeira, we believe, having been created after 1834, although we cannot indicate the date of their respective installations. In 1783, the Republic of Venice already had a consulate in Funchal.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the United States of America, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the Hanseatic Cities, Denmark, England, France, Greece, the Papal States, the Netherlands, Naples, Turkey, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, Spain, Sweden, and Tuscany had consular representation in Madeira, with the consulates of Italy and Germany being created later to replace those of the states incorporated into these two countries. In 1885, there was a consulate of the Hawaiian Islands, now extinct.\n\nThe consulates of the republics of Central and South America, with the exception of Brazil, were all created after 1882, with Uruguay and the Argentine Republic already having consular representation in Funchal in 1888.\n\nIn 1827, a vice-consulate of Brazil was established in Madeira, and the following year a vice-consulate of the Two Sicilies.\n\n## See also: Casa dos Consules.",
