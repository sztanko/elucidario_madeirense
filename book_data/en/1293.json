    "body": "Eucalyptus globulus, originating from Australia, is the only species of the genus Eucalyptus commonly found in Madeira, being present in Monte, Choupana, and several other locations on the island. It reaches large dimensions and develops rapidly, but it is not advisable to plant it near water sources, as it is a species that absorbs a large amount of water through its roots. According to Dr. Jorge Perez, a distinguished physician and naturalist from Tenerife, it is E. globulus, and not E. collossea as some newspapers have stated, that has an effect on the nervous system and stops glucose secretion in diabetes. The former of these species is richer in essential oil than the latter, which is why its leaves should be preferred in the preparation of the infusion used in the treatment of that ailment. The same physician also states that eucalyptus infusion is a medication that should be administered with caution, as there are cases of poisoning caused by it when used in excess. Eucalyptus robusta is also cultivated in Madeira, and in the estate of Mr. Luiz da Rocha Machado, in the parish of Monte, there are three species of Eucalyptus, one of which seems to be E. longifolia. It is reported that E. collossea has recently been sown in Madeira.",
