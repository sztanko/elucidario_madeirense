Guiomar de Sá, daughter of Henrique de Sá, from Porto, or according to some, from João Rodrigues de Sá, who married Gaspar Bettencourt. Pedro Gliz da Câmara, former owner of Lombada (do Arco), was married to D. Joana de Sá, the queen's chief lady-in-waiting, and it is possible that some of their children, if they had any, took the surname from the mother's family.",
