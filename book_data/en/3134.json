He was in England since June 1856, when he learned that the epidemic of cholera morbus was raging on this island; he immediately returned to Funchal to provide his clinical services to the patients, and was attacked by that disease on September 5, 1856, and died the next day. His death was deeply felt by the entire population of Funchal, who had not overlooked the act of selflessness and courage practiced by Dr. Ross.",
