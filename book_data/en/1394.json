    "body": "Beautiful tree cultivated in the estates and some squares of Funchal. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, has persistent leaves of a beautiful green color, and small sycones that do not fully ripen. It is said that the first Figueira da Índia in Madeira came on a ship destined for Europe and shipwrecked in the port of Funchal in the late 18th century. A sailor from that ship managed to bring the mentioned fig tree ashore, and it was planted in the grounds of Quinta Vigia, where it lived for many years, becoming the trunk of all individuals of the same species that later appeared on the island.",
