Given that there is a parish with this name in the province of Algarve and that most of the original colonizers of this island were from the Algarve, it is not surprising that they gave this site the name of that parish. It is also possible that the orographic conditions of the Algarve parish and those of this site, as well as any other points of similarity, gave rise to this denomination. Examples of these are frequent in the history of our discoveries, and even in Madeira, they are not rare.",
