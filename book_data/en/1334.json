Several attempts had been made previously, but without appreciable results.\n\nOn June 25, 1861, the Madeira deputies Antonio Gonçalves de Freitas, Luiz de Freitas Branco, and D. Luiz da Câmara Leme presented a bill in parliament authorizing the construction of a rotating lighthouse at Ponta de S. Lourenço and a fixed lighthouse on Ilhéu da Pontinha. This new attempt also proved to be fruitless.",
