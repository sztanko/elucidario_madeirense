    "body": "Born in Funchal on October 10, 1844, the son of Manuel José Vieira and D. Josefa Carolina do Nascimento Vieira. He attended the high school in Funchal and the Medical-Surgical School, but did not complete the studies of the 1st year of the latter institution. He was a clerk and later secretary of the Funchal Council Administration, and from a very young age, he dedicated himself to journalism, collaborating, when still a student, in the Recreio and Crepusculo, and later in Fusão, Imprensa Livre, Povo, Diário Popular, etc. He was a good poet, but his poems are either scattered in the old periodicals of Funchal, or were never published, being known only to a few friends. He was one of the authors of Guyaneida, a heroic-comic poem mentioned on page 670 of the 1st volume of this Elucidário. João José Vieira was treasurer and later president of the General Assembly of the District, and during the monarchy, he was a member of the progressive party, of which his brother, the councilor Manuel José Vieira, was the local leader. He passed away in 1928.",
