    "body": "This high ridge is located between the parishes of Serra de Água and São Vicente, at an altitude of over a thousand meters and on the crest of the mountain range that runs longitudinally through the interior of Madeira. The road from Ribeira Brava to São Vicente passes through there, and from that point, the northern and southern coasts of the island can be seen, or as the locals say, 'the sea of the north and the sea of the south,' which is indeed the case on clear days. In the parish of Serra de Água, the Madeira Tourism Delegation built a comfortable inn and shelter in 1939, and it is very regrettable that this construction was not erected in a location closer to that prominence.",
