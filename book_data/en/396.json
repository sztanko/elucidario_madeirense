    "body": "Banda de Além is a populated place in the parish of Machico, which occupies a considerable part of the village of the same name and is located on the left bank near the mouth of the river. Most of the individuals engaged in the fishing industry in that locality live there, making it one of the most important fishing centers in the archipelago. The historic chapel of Senhor dos Milagres is located in this place, and its foundation is linked to the discovery and early colonization of this island. It is the center of the most popular pilgrimage in Madeira, held on October 9th of each year, attracting several thousand people on that occasion. A beautiful road starts from this place, partly bordering the picturesque cove and leading directly to the landing pier. It has 243 households and 1090 inhabitants.",
