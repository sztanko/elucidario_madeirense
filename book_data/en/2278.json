    "body": "The construction of this market began in July 1876, and the City Council took out four loans to carry it out, one of 6 contos de réis in 1876, two of 10 contos de réis each, on June 19 and November 7, 1878, and the last one of 34 contos de réis, of which only 4 were destined to pay off old debts of the same market. The amount of the first of these loans was raised by the councilors under their responsibility at the banking house of João José Rodrigues Leitão.\n\nIn the place where the D. Pedro V Market is located (1921), open to the public on December 19, 1880, there was once a workshop for sawing wood, and then some stalls for the sale of fruits and vegetables. It was Servulo Drumond de Meneses, when a councilor of the City Council in 1853, who first suggested the convenience of building the same market.",
