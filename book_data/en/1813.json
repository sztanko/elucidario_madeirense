    "body": "A tree of the Bignoniaceae family, cultivated in the estates, avenues, and gardens of Funchal. It blooms during spring, and its blue flowers grouped in panicles have a beautiful effect. It remains bare or poorly dressed with leaves until the beginning of summer, which makes it very little appreciated as a shade tree and therefore unsuitable for covering streets and public squares, at least under our climate.",
