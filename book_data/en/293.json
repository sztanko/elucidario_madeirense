    "body": "The Associação Comercial do Funchal is one of the most important and also the oldest of all the associations in this city. The history of this distinguished association is also the history of our economic life over a period of eighty-four years, as the matters that are of closest interest to Madeiran commerce and industries have found in it their most staunch defender, unconditionally putting in favor of this archipelago all the prestige, influence, and credit that it rightfully enjoys in our midst. There may have been some rare exceptions, which only serve to confirm the common rule.\n\nThe Governor of Madeira, Luiz da Silva Mousinho de Albuquerque, appointed on July 7, 1835 the commission that was to proceed with the organization and definitive installation of the Associação Comercial, composed of João Shortridge, João Coelho de Meireles, Roque Caetano de Araújo, José Phelps, and Dr. Alexandre de Oliveira. This commission met on July 10, appointing João Shortridge as its president, and promptly proceeded with the work it had been entrusted with, finding the most decided support from all sectors of commerce for the realization of an idea that dated back to the time of absolutism.\n\nThe definitive installation of this association only took place on January 20, 1836, in a house on Rua da Alfândega, which at the time had the number 18, and on the same day the election of its board took place, composed of João Shortridge as president, Roque Caetano de Araújo as vice-president, and the members José Maria Bernes, João Antonio de Gouveia Rego, Joaquim Monteiro de Afonseca, Guilherme Grant, João Coelho de Meireles, and João Crisostomo Ferreira Usel. Its first secretary was Alexandre Luiz da Cunha, a language professor and well-known journalist in his time.\n\nIt was on the very day of its definitive installation and election of the managing board that the statutes were discussed and approved, obtaining the approval of the central government by royal charter on March 12, 1836. These statutes underwent some modifications, and at the general assembly of December 15, 1887, they were profoundly altered, receiving the respective approval by royal decree on May 11, 1888. These statutes presently constitute the organic law of this esteemed association.\n\nWe then present the list of gentlemen who have presided over the destinies of the Associação Comercial do Funchal since its foundation. They are: João Shortridge (1835-1839), João A. de Gouveia Rego (1839-1841), Roque Caetano de Araújo (1841-1842), João Coelho de Meireles (1842-1843), Guilherme Grant (1843-1845), Dr. Alexandre de Oliveira (1845-1847), Edmond Ellicot (1847-1850), Roque Caetano de Araújo (1850-1852), Guilherme Grant (1852-1853), João Antonio de Gouveia Rego (1853-1856), Antonio J. Marques Bastos (1856-1857), Carlos Blandy (1857-1875), Silvano de Freitas Branco (1875-1883), Dr. George Sattler (1883-1886), Dr. Manuel José Vieira (1886-1888), João B. Blandy (1888-1889), Carlos Bianchi (1889-1892), Dr. Manuel José Vieira (1892-1893), Francisco José Nogueira Guimarãis (1893-1895), Manuel Antonio da Silva Passos (1895-1897), Henrique A. Vieira de Castro (1897-1900), Jacob Abudarham (1900-1904), Luiz Gomes da Conceição (1904-1911), Luiz Fialho de Alvelos (1911-1916), Francisco Meira (1916-1919), Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Bettencourt da Camara (1919-1920), Dr. Rui Bettencourt da Câmara (1920-1922), Henrique Augusto Vieira de Castro (1922-1926), José Quirino de Castro (1926-1934), Dr. Juvenal Henriques de Araújo, current President.\n\nIn 1936, the Associação Comercial do Funchal celebrated the 1st centenary of its foundation with various and brilliant commemorations that took place from May 26 to 30 of that year. The commemorative events included a solemn session at the Associação Comercial, a fraternal gathering for the benefit of the School of Arts and Crafts, conferences on the main regional industries, and exhibitions of flowers, embroidery, wines, smoked meats, butter, cement articles, etc. A set of four commemorative stamps was also issued.\n\n> On that occasion, the President of the Portuguese Industrial Association, José Maria Alvares, expressly came to the island, also representing the Commercial Association of Lisbon and the Commercial Association of Porto, with the delivery of special greeting messages. Also, at that time, Mr. Luiz Teixeira, editor of the “Diário de Noticias” from Lisbon, came to Madeira.\n>\n> The press, both from Funchal and Lisbon, referred to the passing of this anniversary and the way it was celebrated, with the most laudatory references.",
