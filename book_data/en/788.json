    "body": "The old Madeiran chronicles extensively cover the acts of bravery and physical strength of Antonio do Carvalhal, with Gaspar Frutuoso detailing many of his courageous actions, which lasted in local tradition for a long time. \"Antonio de Carvalhal, as the Saudades say, a man as chivalrous as he is valiant, noble, and magnificent in his condition and great virtue, with which, through his magnificence, he has acquired so much fame and gained such a name with the will of men who obey him: and if it is necessary to give a shout, he will gather five hundred men from the North to his service for any warlike feat, as has already happened to him, or for any other; and not without reason, because his house is a hospital and shelter for all the poor, lodging for travelers, and refuge finally for the needy. Thus, he spends all his fortune (which he possesses a lot of on this side) in these works, which in his house thirty moyos of wheat are spent every year, besides many others that he lends, and with it he helps those in need, all of whom he gathers from his farm. He resided in the parish of Ponta Delgada and was the son of Pedro Ribeiro and D. Ana Esmeraldo, both of noble descent.",
