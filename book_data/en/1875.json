They were judicial officials and preceded the outside judges in the presidency of the Municipal Chamber of Funchal. The other chambers of the archipelago were presided over by them until the establishment of the liberal government in Madeira in 1834. The law of April 30, 1835 ended the ordinary judges, but the New Judicial Reform of 1837 reinstated them, and they were definitively abolished by the decree of July 20, 1886. Their powers were vested in the Judges of law, in all the courts that were the head of the district or were part of the city or town where there was a head of the district, and in the justices of the peace in all other courts. In the times of absolute government, there were five courts in Madeira, each with its ordinary judge, namely: Machico, Santa Cruz, Ponta do Sol, Calheta, and S. Vicente. In Funchal, the head of the district, there was an outside judge.",
