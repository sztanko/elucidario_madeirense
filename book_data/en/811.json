    "body": "The Madeirans apply this name to the following two fish, both from the Percidae family: Anthias sacer and Callanthias peloritanus. They are caught in rocky bottoms between 60 and 150 fathoms, with the 'gorazeira' or 'briqueira', the latter species being much rarer than the former. The Anthias sacer is also known by the name of emperor, and the Callanthias peloritanus by the name of emperor of natura. Some 60 years ago, this latter species was also called 'castanheta' or 'fashion emperor', perhaps alluding to the fashion of the slender waist of the ladies, as this species is remarkably slimmer than the common emperor. However, today, such a denomination seems to be completely forgotten.",
