    "body": "He was born on this island in the year 1802 and died in Funchal on February 20, 1878. He was a skilled \"provisionist\" lawyer and left some writings, which at the time enjoyed a well-deserved reputation, especially a well-elaborated formulary on various forensic issues. He became well known as a journalist for the violence with which he attacked his adversaries and for the coarse language he generally used, being forced to go into exile to escape the threats of possible reprisals. Only a few years ago, there was frequent talk of the articles of the most acerbic venom that Lobato Machado published in the weekly newspaper A Vergasta, of which he was the chief editor. He was a frequent collaborator of the newspapers \"Amigo do Povo\", \"Clamor Publico\", and \"a Justi√ßa\".",
