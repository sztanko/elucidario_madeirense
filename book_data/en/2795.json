    "body": "A bird of the Puffinidae family, similar to the shearwater, from which it is distinguished by its smaller stature and bluish-gray feet, instead of flesh color. It lives on all the islands of the archipelago, is common in the Desertas, and is also known by the name 'pintelho' because of a particular cry that is heard during its flight. It often leaves during the hot season and usually lays a single white egg in the crevices of rocks, usually on bare ground.",
