    "body": "A bird from the Turdidae family, common in Madeira and often kept in cages due to the beauty of its song. The black color that usually covers the head of the male sometimes extends below the nape, and individuals with this characteristic are called 'toutinegras de capelo', considered by modern ornithologists as a case of melanism. The blackcap builds a nest of intertwined roots on trees, where it lays up to five eggs, which vary in color both in the background and in the ornamentation.",
