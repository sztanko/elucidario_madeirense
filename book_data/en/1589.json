When the Canary Islands were conquered by the Spaniards, they noticed that the inhabitants 'ate roasted barley porridge', and it is believed that 'gofe' is a corruption of 'gofio', and that this term was introduced to the Madeira archipelago by individuals originating from Gran Canaria, La Palma, Tenerife, and La Gomera, who came to our island in the 15th century. (See Slaves). Elisee Reclus says that 'gofio', the national dish of the Canary Islands, is a mass made with flour from various grains, burst over the fire. See Frangolho.",
