It was not yet completed when the island was taken by the Miguelist troops in 1828, and a box of ammunition exploded there. This fort was ordered to be completed by D. Alvaro da Costa and was served by the old road to Cani√ßo.\n\nThere was a small fort on the beach, already ruined at that time and of no importance.",
