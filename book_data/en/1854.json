Pedro 2nd of Brazil and Queen of Portugal D. Maria II. He was a distinguished officer of the French navy and in that capacity visited Madeira several times, commanding some warships. In 1840, the frigates of the French navy La Belle Poule and La Favorite were in our port, carrying out the mission of exhuming the body of Napoleon 1st in Saint Helena and transporting it to France, with the Prince of Joinville as the head of this important and honorable mission. We will refer to this fact more extensively in the article on Napoleon in Madeira.",
