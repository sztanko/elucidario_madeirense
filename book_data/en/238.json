    "body": "Name given to two fish of the Trachinidae family - Trachinus vipera and T. draco. They do not live in deep waters, but are found near the coasts, preferring sandy areas. They have the habit of burying themselves in the sand, leaving only their heads exposed. The sting of the opercular spines and especially the rays of the pectoral fin is very venomous and can cause, in addition to severe pain, violent inflammations sometimes accompanied by fever. Serious accidents of this kind have been experienced by fishermen and bathers on the large beach of Porto Santo, where the two species are not uncommon.",
