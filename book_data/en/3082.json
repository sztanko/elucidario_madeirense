    "body": "He is a native of Porto and the son of the well-known painter Joaquim Vitorino. He resided among us for several years as a teacher at the 'Antonio Augusto de Aguiar' Industrial School, and currently, he is a teacher and director of an industrial school in Porto (1921). He was in Madeira during the celebrations of the quincentenary of the discovery, providing the most relevant services, as we have already noted in the article 'Quincentenary of the Discovery'. In collaboration with Feliciano Soares, he published in 1915 a booklet entitled 'Terra! Terra!', alluding to the discovery of Madeira, written in prose (F. Soares) and verse (E. Ribeiro). Emanuel Ribeiro had a significant contribution to some newspapers in this city and was preparing a historical and artistic monograph about our Cathedral, which he did not publish.",
